            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THeſe Sermons being exactly penned from the Authors own mouth, are now brought to publick view, though when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, had not the leaſt thought to ſuffer them to be Printed: but ſince they were thus prepared to come abroad into the world, the pious Author finding ſo much of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt in viewing of them, could not turn his back upon them.</p>
            <p>As for this godly Author, his worth and excellency is ſo eminently known, it would be vanity in me to ſpeak any thing in relation to his praiſe: let this, and other of his own works praiſe him. Yet thus much I ſhall ſay, That I do verily believe, that he preached theſe choyce Lectures from the boſome of Jeſus Chriſt; that theſe things were the very experiments of his own ſoul, and the lively actings of the Spirit of God within him. What he hath ſeen and heard, he hath declared, that we might have fellowſhip with him, whoſe <hi>fellowſhip is with the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. and therein ſhall our joy be full.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons are not clothed with humane Art, quaint expreſſions, eloquent Speculations, but chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come forth in the nakedneſs of truth, not with <hi>the enticing words of mans wiſdome, but in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi> Here is nothing to fill thy head with barren notions, fruitleſs opinions, or meer ſpeculations; but here is that to fill thy heart with the glory of God, the life of Chriſt, and light of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in a few words hint out what thou ſhalt finde in theſe enſuing Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:184889:4"/> 1. Mans fleſhly righteouſneſs is the great Idol of the world, every one is ready to fall down unto it, and call it bleſſed. This is Antichriſt coming forth in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Chriſt, being arrayed and decked with gold, precious ſtones, and pearls, whereby the Nations are deceived; but when we know the righteouſneſs of the Lord, we ſhall caſt away our own righteouſneſs, and (as the Prophet ſpeaks) ſay unto i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Get ye hence,</hi> Iſa. 30. 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Formality is in no leſs eſteem among us then the former. What is the Religion of moſt people but a meer form, without any life or power at all? Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers tell us, that the upper Planets have their <hi>Stations,</hi> and <hi>Retrogradations,</hi> as well as their direct <hi>Motions.</hi> So 'tis with moſt in their Religion, ſometimes they move forwards, ſometimes backward, ſometimes ſtand at a ſtay, and thus they tread alwayes in one circle or round, turning like a door upon the hinges, but never from off the place where they were. As for moſt mens hearing, praying, faſting, what is it, but as a task, performed ſo coldly, that there is no principle of divine life in it? and thus they go on, but are never at their journeys end. Men commonly uſe what they ſhould enjoy, and enjoy that they ſhould uſe; they will uſe the Lord whom they ſhould enjoy, and they will enjoy their duties and performances, that they ſhould onely uſe: thus they ſtarve their ſouls by formality in Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing we may take notice of, is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt commended to us, before the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Adam.</hi> Moſt of the worlds righteouſneſs proceeds from the principles of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> which is corrupt and fleſhly; what is this but to be born of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the ſon of the bond-woman, to come unto <hi>Mount Sinai in Arabia,</hi> viz. the Covenant of Works? but <hi>Jeruſalem which is above is free,</hi> which is the Mother of all the firſt-born of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Grace. Vain man thinks to climb to heaven by his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, when alas! it is but of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> natural,
<pb facs="tcp:184889:4"/> weak, and fleſhly. All the wiſdome, knowledge, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

But that which is able to reſtore us, is an eſtabliſhment of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt upon our hearts, by the participation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. Chriſt performs all righteouſneſs for his Saints, and then works all righteouſneſs in them. The divine Will of God is righteouſneſs, now Chriſt is that divine Will, brought forth in a Saint, working after the Lords own pleaſure. The Civil Law doth account Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants and Camels to have the nature of wilde Beaſts, though they do the work of tame beaſts: So <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſs commends not to God, we are onely <hi>accepted in the beloved,</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>or ingratiated through that</hi> beloved. The divine treaſures of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are firſt in Chriſt, and by our union with him we come to enjoy them by way of participation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Subſtantial and reall Holineſs ſet out to be farre more excellent then all empty Forms, or meer Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Holineſs is God, ſtamped and printed upon the ſoul; 'tis <hi>Chriſt formed</hi> in the heart; 'tis the very image, frame and diſpoſition of the holy Spirit within us.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That God was but an empty name without vertue: ſo are all our profeſſions of Chriſt without holineſs, that being the very marrow and quinteſſence of all Religion. Holineſs is ſomething of God in us, it proceeds from him, it lives in him; God can no more be ſeparated from it, then the beams from the Sun. Holineſs is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and the more of it we have, the more we have of the life and image of God upon us. Holineſs is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our conformity to God, and our being like him, to be as he is. Holineſs is the new frame, the new
<pb facs="tcp:184889:5"/> creation, the wormanſhip of the Lord in our hearts; it is the Lord building and ſetting up his own Temple, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> within us, filling of us with his own glory, writing his name in our foreheads, by imprinting his own divine image upon us. Oh what happineſs, what ſweet delight, and harmony of heart, what Soul-muſick, and ſpiritual joy is there in having our ſoul wrapt up in the divine life, light, and beauty of the Lords holineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thou haſt a diſcovery of the inability of mans carnal principles or reaſon to judge of ſpiritual things, or the things of God: every truth is diſcovered by principles of light ſuitable to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Apoſtle tells us of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>animate, ſenſuall,</hi> or <hi>naturall man;</hi> and of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſpiritual man, one enlightned by the Spirit of God. Now the natural man is not able to judge of things above the principles of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>No man knows the things of a man, but the ſpirit of man which is in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11.</p>
            <p>The things of man are all created things, man is therefore ſaid to be, as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>little world,</hi> or an Epitome or Compendium wherein all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things are deſcribed, as in a Map or ſhort Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the principle of reaſon in mans heart is able to ſearch out the hidden things of nature. But this large principle of man is too narrow to ſearch into the things of the Spirit: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 14, 15. <hi>The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. The Spirit ſearcheth the deep things of God.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>The wiſdome of the Spirit is but fooliſhneſs to the naturall man.</hi> And why ſo? becauſe ſaith he, <hi>Spiritual things are spiritually diſcerned;</hi> that is, they are to be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, to which, mans carnal reaſon cannot reach. But now ſaith he, <hi>the ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things;</hi> ſo that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things are onely known by the Spirit; 'tis the
<pb facs="tcp:184889:5"/> Spirit of all Truth that leads into all Truth.</p>

               </gap> Treatiſes, 'tis not all Syſtems and Bodies of Divinity, that can reveal the ſecret myſteries of Truth, but it is the work of the Spirit; for the myſtery of Chriſt is not meerly letter and form without, but a quickning Spirit within us. Yet</p>
            <p n="6">6. We are taught, that there is a moſt profound ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reaſoning in godlineſs; and that it is the higheſt act of the minde, which is the higheſt faculty of the ſoul. The minde of a Saint is Gods Throne, and the motions of the minde, or the reaſonings thereof, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt ſwaying the ſoul according to his good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It's true, that reaſon as 'tis in man, is a moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and weak light, and falls ſhort of the light of God, being depraved, and mixt with much darkneſs, and ſo is unſuitable to judge divine things: but reaſon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in its height and excellency, is no other then Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and the Spirit: then ſo much as reaſon hath of the light of God, ſo much it hath of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Then the moſt excellent, the moſt ſupreme, and the ſublimeſt reaſon is in godlineſs, becauſe in it is the greateſt clearneſs, certainty, and light. The Apoſtle calls it <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> now divine reaſon is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is an evidencing of things by the cleareſt, ſureſt, and moſt irreſiſtible light that can be. Now Chriſt is this ſpiritual reaſon, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that which manifeſts is light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13. And what is that light but Chriſt and his Spirit?</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Rom. 8. 4.</bibl>
               <q>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe main drift of the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, is to hold forth <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith,</hi> or by <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,</hi> without the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. the Apoſtle doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer an Objection: for they might ſay, What then ſhall we do with the <hi>Law,</hi> if it cannot <hi>juſtifie</hi> us? There the Apoſtle tells us, that though the <hi>Law</hi> cannot <hi>juſtifie</hi> us, yet there are many bleſſed uſes, both for <hi>Sinners</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> to make of the <hi>Law:</hi> of which I ſhall not now ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Now in this eighth Chapter the Apoſtle draws this concluſion from what he had ſaid before: <hi>There is therefore</hi> (from what I have ſaid) it is evident that there is <hi>no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:184889:7"/> there is no <hi>damnation,</hi> there is no <hi>danger</hi> of Hell <hi>to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now he opens who thoſe are; he ſaith they are thoſe <hi>who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> And he gives a reaſon of it in <hi>ver.</hi> 2. why there is no damnation to thoſe people: <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made us free from the law of ſin and of death.</hi> Now he amplifies that in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; Thus it comes about that we are now <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>law,</hi> and that there is no <hi>damnation</hi> to us, becauſe ſaith he, that God hath ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, like one of us; and he hath <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God, and condemned ſin; therefore there is no <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> us, nor no jot of the <hi>law</hi> that is not <hi>fulfilled:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are juſt, and righteous, and clear. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> for God hath ſent his Son to condemn ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the fourth Verſe it is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſſed; <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not orderly go over, to ſhew the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:184889:7"/> Coherence diſtinctly, as I might; but briefly as I can, come to thoſe Leſſons that the Lord is to teach us.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            <p>There are in the words two things.</p>
            <p>Here is a great <hi>Priviledge</hi> as any can be, to have the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> fulfilled in us.</p>
            <p>And here are ſecondly the parties that have the benefit of this Priviledge, <hi>Thoſe that walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Priviledge,</hi> to underſtand the words a little. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us:</hi> That the <hi>law</hi> might be fully <hi>ſatisfied</hi> in point of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that the <hi>law</hi> might have ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which indeed the law requires, that it might have a <hi>full,</hi> and compleat righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us. So that briefly theſe are the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I ſhall open from hence, which I deſire that our ſouls may feed upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that</p>
            <q>The law requires of every man a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to fulfill it.</q>
            <p>Or, that</p>
            <q>Every man is bound to get him a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to fulfil the law of God.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Every</hi> man is bound to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God. That is one thing.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:184889:8"/>
            <p> The ſecond Leſſon will be this, that</p>
            <q>The law is perfectly fulfilled or ſatisfied in all true Believers.</q>
            <p>And thirdly, that</p>
            <q>
               <hi>All thoſe that are true Believers</hi> (or that have theſe Priviledges) <hi>they are thoſe that walk not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe are the three Leſſons I ſhall ſpeak of. I ſay firſt,</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The law requireth a righteouſneſs from every man, to fulfill it.</hi> Or</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every man is bound to fulfill the law of God.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>That is the firſt thing. The grounds of that are theſe: I ſhall but touch them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe that <hi>God</hi> made man, man was his <hi>creature,</hi> and the Lord was his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign:</hi> and when God made all Creatures, you know he made <hi>laws</hi> for them; he made a <hi>law</hi> for the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> &amp;c. and every thing goes according to the <hi>law</hi> that God determined for it. Now when God made man, (who was but his Creature, though he were a more excellent Creature) he made a <hi>law</hi> for him, this bleſſed <hi>law</hi> of God which is in his Book here, the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> as it was ſometimes called: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all other Creatures were bound to go in their courſe, and keep their peculiar <hi>laws</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:184889:8"/> that God laid on them, ſo man alſo was bound to keep the <hi>law</hi> of God that God made for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Another thing is this, that beſides the Soveraignty of God, that might impoſe a law upon him there was ſecondly a <hi>Compact</hi> between God &amp; man, and ſo there was a kind of <hi>bargain:</hi> for God laid that law upon man, and <hi>Adam</hi> as a <hi>publick perſon</hi> he undertook to keep that law by a <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>bargain.</hi> If God (as it were) had had no right before to lay it on him, yet now man undertook it, by way of <hi>bargain</hi> to keep the law of God. <hi>Adam</hi> firſt did it, and might have done it: and afterwards the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> profeſs to do it; <hi>All theſe words we will do:</hi> we will keep them. That is another Reaſon whereby it appears, that <hi>every</hi> man and woman in the world is bound to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Another thing is this, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what there is that might <hi>free</hi> a man from <hi>keeping</hi> a <hi>law</hi> that is laid upon him, you ſhall ſee that there are none of thoſe things that can help him in this. As</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, our <hi>Laws</hi> many times are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed;</hi> and that Law that a man was bound to keep a few years ago, he is bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt now; as the <hi>Service-book,</hi> the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. there is that penalty now for <hi>uſing</hi> it, as there was for <hi>not</hi> uſing it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:184889:9"/> a few years ſince. Now it is not ſo with the law of God; <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but one jot or tittle of the law ſhall not paſs.</hi> That law is an eternal law, there is no repealing of it.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, you know <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers</hi> among men may be <hi>corrupted,</hi> and <hi>bribed,</hi> and may be brought to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with their <hi>own</hi> Laws, nay ſometimes to go <hi>againſt</hi> their own <hi>laws:</hi> but God is a juſt God, and when his own Son, the Son of his love, did take upon him to be born <hi>under the law,</hi> and to be a <hi>Surety</hi> for man, he endured the ſmart of the <hi>law,</hi> and was dealt with as if he had been another.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, there is no <hi>evaſion,</hi> or <hi>eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:</hi> among men there is. If a man break the Law, and go into <hi>another Country,</hi> he is clear, and <hi>free:</hi> but here is no <hi>eſcaping,</hi> one cannot go away. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy preſence,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 139. <hi>where ſhall I hide my ſelf from thee?</hi> A man can go no where but the law of God will be on him. So that <hi>every</hi> man and woman in the world are ſtill <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> law of God, or to get a <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> a <hi>perfect</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the law of God.</p>
            <p>Now there are but three wayes in the world to fulfill the law of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Either a man muſt do it in his <hi>own</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:184889:9"/> 
               <hi>perſon,</hi> as moſt men do (beſides <hi>Papiſts)</hi> more or leſs, they will go and do their <hi>beſt,</hi> and do the <hi>good,</hi> leave the <hi>evil,</hi> and perform <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and they think by their doing to keep the law.</p>
            <p>Or elſe ſecondly, by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> that is, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>this</hi> world, and afterwards in <hi>Hell:</hi> for that is the buſineſs of <hi>Hell,</hi> for <hi>Hell</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the place where people are <hi>fulfilling</hi> the law of God. What doth <hi>Cain,</hi> and other wretches do in Hell? They are <hi>paying</hi> the <hi>debt, fulfilling</hi> the law of God to <hi>eternity</hi> by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> becauſe they did not fulfill it by <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> while they were here. That is the reaſon that they are in Hell for <hi>ever,</hi> becauſe they can <hi>never</hi> pay the <hi>debt,</hi> therefore they muſt abide there for <hi>ever:</hi> for if it could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they could give a compleat <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> that might <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the law, they ſhould ſtay in Priſon no longer, they ſhould be in Hell no more.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, there is another glorious way, that is, in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt he hath <hi>kept</hi> the <hi>law,</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled it; now a man by <hi>believing</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, and by being <hi>united</hi> to him, and <hi>married</hi> to him, that in his <hi>own</hi> perſon hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the law, being married to him, whatſoever he hath is yours, and whatſoever <hi>he</hi> hath done, it is as if it had been done by <hi>you;</hi> all ſhall be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:184889:10"/> to you, and ſo the law of God may be <hi>fulfilled</hi> in <hi>you</hi> perfectly, and you ſhall never go to <hi>Hell,</hi> and have nothing to do or to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in that kinde. This being premiſed briefly; the Uſe of this may be twofold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To ſhew you what a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> thing it is for a man to go about to <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God in his <hi>own</hi> ſtrength, or in his <hi>own</hi> perſon: for you to think to <hi>ſave</hi> your <hi>Souls,</hi> or to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> by your own doings. Beloved, it is a great matter to bring poor <hi>ſinners</hi> to be <hi>awakened</hi> to <hi>ſee</hi> their ſins, or to break off their courſe in ſin: for there are many <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>jeerers</hi> of Religion, and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners</hi> of the Lords day, that ſit as <hi>ſots</hi> all the year, and are never <hi>awakened:</hi> but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally when men are <hi>awakened</hi> out of their <hi>ſins,</hi> this is the <hi>reſolution</hi> of all mankinde, of every man, none excepted, unleſs God have mercy on him; he is ready to ſay, I ſee I am in a <hi>damnable</hi> way, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s courſe will bring me to <hi>Hell,</hi> by the grace of God I wil turn over a new leaf, and now I will hear <hi>Sermons,</hi> I was wont to <hi>jeer</hi> at them, and I will get me a <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> or ſome other good Book &amp; I will have <hi>prayers</hi> in my houſe, and I will be <hi>drunk</hi> no more, and <hi>ſwear</hi> no more; I will be a new man, I will <hi>avoid</hi> that which is <hi>evil,</hi> &amp; <hi>do</hi> that which is <hi>good.</hi> And mark it, this is more <hi>natural</hi> to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:184889:10"/> man then ſin: it is more natural to man to be <hi>righteous</hi> then to be <hi>ſinfull;</hi> becauſe he was righteous <hi>before</hi> he was ſinful. The liquor that is put <hi>firſt</hi> into a veſſel, the veſſel keeps the <hi>taſte</hi> of that longer then of any that is put into it afterwards. Now God at <hi>firſt</hi> made man <hi>righteous,</hi> and man is more apt to fall to that kinde of righteouſneſs, then to any ſin. And this is the great <hi>miſery</hi> of people, every one in ſome faſhion or other, this is his <hi>buſineſs</hi> he goes about, to fulfill the law of God in his <hi>own</hi> perſon: and there you ſhall have one <hi>praying,</hi> and another <hi>crying,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other keeping ſo many <hi>faſts,</hi> and dayes of <hi>humiliation</hi> upon humiliation; and the end of all is, if men had eyes to ſee it, his endeavour is to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God; he endeavours to <hi>ſcrape,</hi> and to get up a <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to <hi>pay</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>You cannot conceive, and comprehend how ſubject you and I are to this miſery; and how this is in your very bones (as it were) and I fear truly it is the greateſt part of your <hi>Religion,</hi> and the moſt of your <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> is nothing but to endeavour to get a <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of God, though ſome do it in a <hi>cloſer,</hi> finer way then others.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you conſider this word, lay down this throughly in your hearts, that it is a <hi>vain</hi> thing ſo to do; and who would go
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:184889:11"/> about a vain thing, a thing that he ſhall never bring to <hi>perfection?</hi> For it is not every <hi>paltry</hi> righteouſneſs that can <hi>fulfill</hi> the law of God. It is not ten thouſand <hi>faſtings</hi> that can fulfill the law of God; it is not <hi>praying</hi> in your family three times a day that can fulfill the law. I ſpeak not againſt theſe things in their right way and courſe: but all will not do in this reſpect; for if you fail but <hi>once,</hi> if you miſs but one farthing you are gone, if you have but <hi>one</hi> bad <hi>thought</hi> in all your life, you are loſt. Therefore I would have you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of getting by your own <hi>doing,</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> any righteouſneſs to <hi>fulfill</hi> the law of God, never go about it. No wiſe man will go and build a <hi>Caſtle</hi> in the <hi>Aire.</hi> It is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and argument enough in any <hi>naturall</hi> buſineſs to make a man deſiſt, to tell him it is a <hi>vain</hi> thing, it is a work that will never come to <hi>perfection,</hi> therefore deſiſt, and give over, and think of ſome other courſe. Why ſhould we not prevail in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things, as well as in <hi>natural?</hi> Let every man lay down this for a certain truth, for a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in his Soul, That I were as good be a <hi>ſinner,</hi> as a <hi>righteous</hi> man in my <hi>own</hi> perſon, in reſpect of <hi>fulfilling</hi> the law, I am ſure I ſhall never do it; but as a Snow-ball, the more it is rolled, the bigger it grows: ſo the more you go on, and endeavour to get
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:184889:11"/> a <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to fulfill the law, the <hi>farther</hi> off you will be: for (as I ſaid) if you fail but <hi>once,</hi> you are guilty of all.</p>
            <p>And as you cannot reach it by doing, ſo not by ſuffering; for what men have miſt in <hi>doing,</hi> they ſhall be <hi>ſuffering</hi> to all eternity in Hell: but the <hi>law</hi> is ſo <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> is ſo <hi>glorious</hi> whoſe law you have broken, that when you have ſuffered <hi>millions,</hi> yet the <hi>debt</hi> will be ſtill unpaid. Therefore who would be ſo <hi>mad</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Galatians</hi> mad Galatians; <hi>Who hath bewitched you?)</hi> it is a kinde of <hi>madneſs</hi> for any man to attempt in his <hi>own</hi> perſon, by <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>ſuffering</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> the righteouſneſs of the <hi>law,</hi> or to <hi>juſtifie,</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> his <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will ſay, We grant it is true, and therefore the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are much to blame, that labour to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by their works. They are ſo, and ſo are many <hi>others</hi> much to blame beſides them; and <hi>bleſſed</hi> is that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among you, whoſoever it be, that doth not in ſome meaſure in his <hi>own</hi> perſon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make up his <hi>own</hi> righteouſneſs. It is a thing that ſticks nearer to you then you are aware of: though it may be at ſometimes you ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>juſtification</hi> by him clearly, yet at other times you know how many <hi>pangs,</hi> and how many ſecret <hi>glances</hi> we have at our <hi>juſtification</hi> by our <hi>own</hi> works: take notice
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:184889:12"/> of the <hi>vanity</hi> of this. That is one word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Me-thinks this ſhould move you above all things in the world if it were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and oh that the Lord would be pleaſed yet to open your eyes while it is called to day! I ſay, this ſhould be one of the greateſt <hi>motives</hi> in the world to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>get</hi> into Chriſt, to <hi>receive</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and in <hi>him</hi> (as I ſhall ſhew after) you ſhall have a <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> that hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the <hi>law.</hi> Let every man ſay, I ſee here is <hi>law</hi> that God hath laid upon me, I am ſubject to it, and this law muſt be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> there is no help for it, <hi>every</hi> man is bound to it, he muſt have a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> to ſatisfie the <hi>law,</hi> Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, rather then that ſhall not be. Now there are but three wayes to fulfill it; Either in mine <hi>own</hi> perſon here; or to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for ever in Hell; or elſe to <hi>believe</hi> in, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> another that may do it for me. Now we neither our by <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>ſuffering</hi> can get ſuch a <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> that is clear: therefore there is but <hi>one</hi> way, that is, in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there is a <hi>perfect</hi> righteouſneſs in him, he hath <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> the <hi>law;</hi> get into him, and be <hi>one</hi> with him, and then we ſhall be able to ſay perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Paul, That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us that believe,</hi> and are in Jeſus Chriſt. There is but that <hi>one</hi> way: now when there is but <hi>one</hi> way, me-thinks
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:184889:12"/> there needs no <hi>deliberation,</hi> or <hi>conſultation.</hi> In worldly things, when there are <hi>divers</hi> wayes and courſes that a man may take, he will <hi>conſult</hi> with his friends, <hi>which</hi> to take, <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> or the <hi>other;</hi> but when there is but <hi>one</hi> way, there needs no <hi>conſultation.</hi> So if there were <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> or <hi>many</hi> wayes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> we might <hi>conſult</hi> which way to take: if there were as many wayes as you imagine, and make in your own heads; if <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> were the onely way, or <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi> were the onely way, men might <hi>demurre:</hi> but in Gods language there is but <hi>one</hi> way, and that is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>way,</hi> go out of that, and you <hi>wander</hi> for ever, he is the onely <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> miſs that, and there is <hi>no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> There is but this <hi>one thing neceſſary;</hi> there is no other way in the world but Jeſus Chriſt, there is <hi>no other name under heaven by which you can be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we ſhould do in our condition juſt as a man that were fallen into a great <hi>pit,</hi> that were full of <hi>ſtones,</hi> and <hi>ſnakes,</hi> and <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> and all that we can imagine to be terrible and miſerable, and there comes a man and caſts a <hi>Rope</hi> into this great deep <hi>pit;</hi> you need not perſwade the man to lay <hi>hold</hi> of it, he would preſently <hi>catch</hi> at it as ſoon as it comes. Why ſo? Becauſe he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:184889:13"/> knows he is in a <hi>miſerable</hi> caſe, and there is no <hi>other</hi> way to help him but that. We are fallen into ſuch a <hi>pit,</hi> where there are <hi>ſnakes,</hi> and <hi>ſcorpions,</hi> and <hi>ſerpents,</hi> and <hi>fire;</hi> the <hi>ſting</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> the <hi>curſe</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we are in the paws of the <hi>Devil,</hi> we are in a manner in <hi>Hell</hi> already; and God hath ſent his <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Therefore what ſhall I ſay to you but this? I beſeech you ſtand not <hi>trifling,</hi> and <hi>dallying,</hi> and <hi>whining,</hi> and go to this Preacher, and ſay, <hi>what</hi> ſhall I do Sir? and to that Chriſtian, <hi>what</hi> courſe ſhall I take? as though there were <hi>many</hi> wayes, and you had choice of things. What ſhouldeſt thou do, but <hi>ſtudy</hi> Jeſus Chriſt throughly, and roundly, make a <hi>work</hi> of it, or elſe thou wilt be <hi>damned.</hi> There is no <hi>other way</hi> left, there is no <hi>other means</hi> to be had; God will not abate <hi>one</hi> farthing token, the <hi>law</hi> muſt be <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:</hi> as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> when they made <hi>brick,</hi> they muſt bring in ſuch a <hi>number;</hi> ſo the law muſt be perfectly <hi>ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and thou art not able to do it by <hi>doing</hi> here, or by <hi>ſuffering</hi> in Hell: therefore what ſhall I do? <hi>Receive</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſtudy</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>reſign</hi> thy ſelf wholly up to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtand not trifling, and dallying,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:184889:13"/> till thou go to the <hi>Devil</hi> in Hell, as many do. If there were twenty wayes to Heaven, God might ſay, I wonder not that yonder people ſtand <hi>muſing,</hi> and <hi>conſulting</hi> a twelve-month together; but when there is but <hi>one</hi> way, and yet people ſtand moping, it is that that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers God.</p>
            <p>Therefore remember that in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Gather your ſelves together before the decree bring forth: before the day paſs as the chaff,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Seek ye the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Gather your ſelves together: He doth not mean in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,</hi> as you uſe to meet in the <hi>Guild-Hall;</hi> but the meaning is, when he ſaith <hi>Gather your ſelves together,</hi> that man is a <hi>worried</hi> creature, a <hi>ſhattered</hi> thing, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The eyes of a wiſe man are in his head, but the eyes of a fool are over the world.</hi> There are abundance of men that have their <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> go in the world <hi>this</hi> way, and <hi>that</hi> way; but <hi>gather your ſelves</hi> together: How? To <hi>get</hi> into Chriſt: you hear that there is <hi>no Righteouſneſs</hi> but his will ſerve the turn, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſelves to <hi>ſtudy</hi> Chriſt, to <hi>obey</hi> Chriſt, to <hi>receive</hi> Chriſt, to <hi>love</hi> Chriſt, and to <hi>reſign</hi> your ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, in whom there is a perfect <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> That is one Leſſon you ſhould deſire the Lord to teach you hence.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:184889:14"/>
            <p> The next Leſſon is this, that</p>
            <q>The Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in all true Believers.</q>
            <p>Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>That the law might be fulfilled in us. In us;</hi> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it <hi>perſonally,</hi> as though any <hi>Saint,</hi> though it were <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, were able in his own <hi>perſon</hi> to fulfill the <hi>law;</hi> but the meaning of it is, in reſpect of the <hi>union</hi> that we have with Jeſus Chriſt, who is our <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> and our <hi>Head.</hi> The law is perfectly <hi>fulfilled</hi> by <hi>him,</hi> therefore it is perfectly <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> by <hi>me,</hi> becauſe I am <hi>united</hi> to him. The law is not perfectly <hi>fulfilled</hi> by me, becauſe I do <hi>more good,</hi> or do <hi>leſs evil</hi> then another, but onely the law is <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and hath reaſon to be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> becauſe I am <hi>married</hi> to one that hath done it, and that perfectly.</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall ſee divers Scriptures that hold it forth bleſſedly. As thoſe phraſes in <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. the latter end, where it is ſaid we are dead to the law: <hi>I through the law am dead to the law; I am crucified with Chriſt. I am dead to the law:</hi> What is the meaning of that? That is, I am <hi>dead</hi> to the <hi>law,</hi> as it is a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of works; the law hath no more to do with me, then the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>men</hi> have to do with a man that is in debt when he is <hi>dead,</hi> when he is <hi>dead</hi> he is <hi>free</hi> from it. So the law is <hi>paid</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, it is fully <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:184889:14"/> owe not one farthing, or farthing worth to the Law: <hi>I am dead to the law.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. you know, how by the compariſon of a man and his wife, we are ſaid to be dead to the law of God. The meaning is not as though the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and matter of the law were not <hi>eternal,</hi> and a rule for all Saints, doubtleſs it is in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament as well as in the <hi>Old:</hi> but the law as it is a <hi>Contract,</hi> a <hi>Bond,</hi> a <hi>Bargain,</hi> as it is a <hi>Covenant of works</hi> between God and us, it is <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled by Chriſt, and we are <hi>dead</hi> to it, we are <hi>free</hi> from it, or <hi>delivered</hi> from it. And that is the reaſon that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. it is ſaid, in <hi>Mount Sion we are come to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> that is, not of <hi>juſt</hi> men <hi>perſonally,</hi> juſt in their dealings, though that follow in a ſort: but the meaning is, that every Saint that is in Jeſus Chriſt is perfectly a <hi>juſt</hi> man, or a <hi>juſt</hi> woman, by reaſon of their <hi>marriage</hi> with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who hath obtained a perfect <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>juſtice</hi> for them. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. you have there alſo a bleſſed place, where the Apoſtle ſaith we are ſaved, not onely by the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, but by his <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is three times repeated, <hi>we are ſaved by the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> and again, <hi>by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> and again in <hi>ver.</hi> 26. the third time, <hi>to declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs.</hi> What is the righteouſneſs of God? that is,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:184889:15"/> ſaith he, that <hi>he is juſt, and a juſtifier of them that believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> with God to <hi>ſave</hi> his people that <hi>believe</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt. Why ſo? Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> to a tittle all the law of God for them.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. I ſhall give you but one word of Uſe, and leave the Reaſons, and the further enlarging of it till the Afternoon. And the word that I deſire to make known to you from the Lord is this, To inſtruct and help you a little to underſtand where your <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> doth lye, or upon what your <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is built. For this is the <hi>miſery,</hi> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>miſery</hi> of moſt Chriſtians, that they <hi>miſlay</hi> their <hi>juſtification:</hi> they do lay it partly upon <hi>faith,</hi> and partly upon their <hi>ſanctification</hi> and <hi>holineſs;</hi> and that is the reaſon that when a poor ſoul, it may be, is <hi>tempted</hi> to ſome <hi>ſin,</hi> and hath ſome ſtrong <hi>luſt,</hi> he loſeth his faith, and his aſſurance, and his peace of conſcience, becauſe he grounds his <hi>Saintſhip,</hi> and his <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> upon his <hi>holineſs.</hi> Now Beloved, this is it that I would deſire the Lord to bring you and me to, to know that I am a <hi>juſt</hi> man onely by the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> that is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the law is <hi>perfectly fulfilled</hi> for <hi>me</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, and not <hi>partly</hi> by <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> by <hi>me,</hi> but onely and perfectly by him, and I am called <hi>juſt,</hi> but onely <hi>as,</hi> or <hi>becauſe</hi> I am <hi>united</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:184889:15"/> to him that hath gotten a perfect <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> for me.</p>
            <p>Then let me build my <hi>Juſtification</hi> upon that <hi>onely,</hi> and not upon what I am; not upon my <hi>temper,</hi> or upon my <hi>graces,</hi> or my <hi>gifts,</hi> or the like: take heed of that; but let it be built wholly upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. He was delivered for our offences, and roſe again for our juſtification.</hi> Let us build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, that we may come to this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, once to have our <hi>juſtification</hi> in a <hi>ſtock</hi> clearly in Jeſus Chriſts hands, that when we do <hi>good</hi> we may not imagine that we are a jot the more <hi>juſtified,</hi> or when we <hi>fall</hi> or <hi>fail</hi> in good, we may not conceive that we are a jot leſs <hi>juſtified</hi> then before, that though one day we have our hearts <hi>inlarged</hi> to do good, and to do more good in <hi>one</hi> day then it may be we did in a <hi>moneth</hi> before, yet this goes not to the <hi>ſtock</hi> of my <hi>juſtification,</hi> I am not one jot the more <hi>juſtified:</hi> and ſometimes God leaves the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>remnants of ſin</hi> that <hi>foil</hi> us, and I will <hi>mourn</hi> for it, and be <hi>humbled</hi> for it, as a <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> againſt my <hi>father,</hi> but I am not a jot more <hi>unjuſtified</hi> then I was before in the ſight of God, in regard of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>works</hi> that Chriſt hath <hi>fulfilled.</hi> So thus I would have you do as your Merchants and Tradeſmen in your City, you have a certain <hi>Stock,</hi> that you lock, it may be, in an iron
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:184889:16"/> Cheſt, and that ſtock is the <hi>quick</hi> as you call it, and you have beſides ſo many <hi>pounds,</hi> or ſo many <hi>hundreds</hi> that you turn and wind about through all the year, as you have occaſion; but from the <hi>ſtock,</hi> the <hi>quick,</hi> you will not lay any thing out of that, you will not <hi>touch</hi> that, but lay out in <hi>expences,</hi> and winde and turn the reſt. Juſt ſo I would have it with you, that ſeeing <hi>juſtification</hi> is <hi>onely</hi> built on Chriſt, and I have the <hi>word of faith</hi> to certifie me of it, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of faith to ſhew it me within, I would not have my <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> to be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient</hi> into that, but leave that as a <hi>ſtock</hi> clearly in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt. Or as we ſee a maid or woman that <hi>ſpins,</hi> ſhe holds one hand <hi>ſteady,</hi> and turns about the wheel with the <hi>other:</hi> ſo our <hi>juſtification</hi> we ſhould hold it <hi>ſteady,</hi> for it is not built at all upon <hi>any</hi> thing that is in <hi>us,</hi> but let us turn and winde the reſt, that is, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> we muſt <hi>ſtrive</hi> againſt ſin, and <hi>mourn</hi> for it, but leave <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> wholly to Chriſt, for it is not built on <hi>me,</hi> but is onely by the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt. Therefore as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. when we have done all the good we can, <hi>ſay we are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> I have not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one <hi>farthing</hi> to day, nor in all my life to help to <hi>fulfill</hi> the law of God, or to help to my <hi>juſtification,</hi> that is onely in the hands of Chriſt, that is my <hi>quick,</hi> my <hi>caſh,</hi> my <hi>ſtock,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:184889:16"/> and when thou <hi>faileſt,</hi> and ſeeſt <hi>luſts,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>wantonneſs</hi> ariſe in thee, ſay, this hath no influence to hinder my <hi>juſtification,</hi> it is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient into that, that is built upon another thing, it is wholly in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> he hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> the law, and I am <hi>juſt</hi> by <hi>marriage,</hi> and by <hi>union</hi> with him.

               <q>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are three Leſſons that we ſhould learn from theſe words. The firſt is implied, <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law muſt be fulfilled.</hi> Or, <hi>Every man is bound to fulfill the law of God.</hi> That we have already done with.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:184889:17"/>
            <p> Secondly, <hi>That the Law of God is perfectly fulfilled in all true Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That true Believers are they who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We made ſome entrance upon the ſecond, <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in all true believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpake a little of this, and ſhall adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to what I ſaid, if God will.</p>
            <q>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in every true believer.</q>
            <p>Not perſonally, as I told you: for there is <hi>no</hi> Saint, no not <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf that can ſay, <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in me,</hi> that is, <hi>perſonally;</hi> that I have walked ſo the law is <hi>ſatisfied</hi> by my walking. But the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us, not <hi>perſonally,</hi> but in us by reaſon that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are <hi>one,</hi> and he is made righteouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>He is made of God to us, wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt is, or hath, it is ours. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us.</hi> He doth not ſay, it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> though that be true, but he takes the boldneſs to ſay, it is fulfilled in <hi>us,</hi> by virtue of our <hi>union</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt. So in every true Saint or believer, the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the law through Chriſt is perfectly <hi>fulfilled.</hi> The <hi>weakeſt</hi> Saint, if he be a <hi>true</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:184889:17"/> Saint, he hath <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled the law of God, he hath perfectly ſatisfied every <hi>demand</hi> that the law can make, he hath perfectly paid every peny-worth of debt that he oweth to the law: the weakeſt Saint, it may be a <hi>poor</hi> Saint that men can ſee nothing but corruption in all the <hi>day,</hi> and all the <hi>week,</hi> and all the <hi>year</hi> long almoſt, yet that man, if he be a <hi>true</hi> Saint, though he be weak, hath <hi>perfectly</hi> in Chriſt kept the law of God, and is a juſt man, and the law of God cannot come upon him, nor the <hi>Sergeant</hi> the Devil to arreſt him for one peny or farthing, becauſe he can ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us.</hi> Therefore that is the reaſon, as I told you, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am dead to the law,</hi> that is, I am as <hi>free</hi> from the law as a man that is <hi>dead:</hi> when a man is dead, the law goes no further on him. So it is ſaid, we are <hi>delivered</hi> from the law, and <hi>freed</hi> from the law: and that is the reaſon alſo that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle three times in one Chapter puts our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of God; he faith not by the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, though that be true, there is infinite mercy, but ſaith he, that <hi>God might declare his righteouſneſs</hi> in Chriſt to ſave us. It is a <hi>merciful</hi> thing for God to give us Chriſt, and to give us <hi>hearts</hi> to know that Chriſt, and to believe in that Chriſt, it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy: but now that we are in Chriſt,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:184889:18"/> and united in him, as there was mercy, ſo it is <hi>righteous,</hi> and juſt with God to ſave us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are <hi>righteous</hi> perſons. Miſtake me not, I ſay every poor Saint <hi>through</hi> Chriſt is a righteous perſon, a juſt man: I ſay in and through Chriſt, he hath taken away all our ſins, and forgiven all our <hi>iniquities, Coloſſ.</hi> 2. So that when God ſaves believers, he doth not onely <hi>ſave</hi> them out of <hi>mercy,</hi> but out of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> he can do no otherwiſe: therefore it is three times over, <hi>his righteouſneſs, his righteouſneſs, his righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 3. And that is a bleſſed word in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Ye are come to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> I do not conceive that it is ſpoken of the ſpirits of men in <hi>heaven,</hi> as many do; and no wonder they miſtake, for I did ſo for many years. That place it looks ſo like <hi>heaven,</hi> that I took it for heaven it ſelf; <hi>Ye are come unto mount Sion, to the general aſſembly, and Church of the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> A man would think it were heaven it ſelf; it is called <hi>heaven,</hi> but it is nothing in the world but the glorious eſtate of the Saints in Jeſus Chriſt under the New-Teſtament, as you may ſee afterwards.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>let this word ſink into your hearts,</hi> that if thou be a right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, thou art perfectly <hi>juſt</hi> and righteous through Jeſus Chriſt, as if thou hadſt never
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:184889:18"/> ſinned againſt the law of God: not by thy <hi>own</hi> righteouſneſs, but by the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. For what can be ſaid more? faith the Apoſtle, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled.</hi> He doth not ſay we have a piece of it, but it is <hi>fulfilled,</hi> that is, to an <hi>Iota</hi> or tittle; the law cannot ſay, <hi>Black is thine eye,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath paid and done all that it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>Now to give you a word or two of the grounds or Reaſons, to help you to believe this truth, to ſhew you how it comes about. It comes about three wayes, I mean it will be clear to you three wayes, if you conſider three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, You muſt conſider that Jeſus Chriſt, which is our Surety, he was ſent of the Father, out of his love as a publick perſon to fulfil the law of God, by <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> as a publick perſon. There is much comfort in that. Beloved, you can never throughly underſtand your juſtification, unleſs you ſtudy the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> what kinde of perſon <hi>Adam</hi> was, as you may ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Now the Lord Jeſus, he came a publick perſon, and <hi>he was delivered for our offences,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. he did die for our ſins. That's one thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Now the ſecond thing that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates this to us, is, beſides his <hi>dying</hi> as a publick perſon, there is a <hi>union</hi> made between every
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:184889:19"/> poor believer and Chriſt, as really as between Chriſt and his Father. Indeed it is called in Scripture a <hi>Marriage,</hi> becauſe as in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage all the wealth of the Husband is the Wives, it becomes hers, and ſhe hath a right to it after Marriage; ſo all that is in Chriſt becomes ours by this <hi>union.</hi> But it is a more real union, a <hi>cloſer</hi> union by far then that of Marriage; it is compared to the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Members and the Head: now by this union, that you may reade of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. all that is <hi>ours</hi> becomes Chriſts, and all that is <hi>Chriſts</hi> becomes ours. There are two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Then thirdly, we finde that God the Father, to whom the debt was owing, and whoſe law this was that we muſt ſatisfie, he acknowledgeth <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> And what can we have more? God the Father acknowledgeth that his Son hath ſatisfied the law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are freed. Now he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it three wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You ſhall have it <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. compared with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. for <hi>Peter</hi> is much in it, <hi>We fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not deviſed fables,</hi> but we come to ſpeak of the voice in the Mount, <hi>This is my beloved Son.</hi> As if he had ſaid, This is one main piece of the Goſpel, we heard a voice when we were with our Maſter in the Mount, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom my ſoul is well pleaſed.</hi> That for his perſon.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:184889:19"/>
            <p> Then a ſecond thing that did ſhew that he was <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> was by ſuffering Jeſus Chriſt after he was <hi>arreſted,</hi> and in <hi>priſon</hi> for our debt (for Chriſt was in priſon for our debt; he was arreſted, and that according to law, he was brought into priſon, and all our Suits were clapped on his back, all our <hi>Executions</hi> and <hi>Outlaries</hi> were laid on his ſhoulders, and then the Father let him out of priſon being our Surety: if he had not paid our debt, he had not come out of priſon, but) now the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lets him out, that is, the Father ſuffered him to <hi>riſe</hi> from the dead. Therefore we find that our juſtification is laid more upon the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, then upon his <hi>death,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that is, he did die for our ſins, and was raiſed again for our juſtification. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him give us all things? Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us:</hi> that is, his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us did ſatisfie the law, but that did not <hi>juſtifie</hi> us, untill we ſee that he was <hi>riſen</hi> again; and then we ſee that all the debt is paid, becauſe our Surety is gotten out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Therefore juſtification (I mean the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:184889:20"/> of it at leaſt) principally ariſeth from Chriſts <hi>reſurrection.</hi> Now when I ſee Chriſt is <hi>riſen,</hi> and gone abroad, he is gone out of the grave, and gone to heaven, I know that the law is fulfilled, and the Father is ſatisfied, and the Sergeant the Devil hath nothing to arreſt me for, all is ſatisfied, all is clear.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, I know God the Father is <hi>ſatisfied;</hi> for the law it is God the Fathers <hi>Writ</hi> that he had againſt us: and now we ſee that all is paid, not onely becauſe our Surety is got out of priſon, (for ſo a man may do that hath not paid a debt) but becauſe when he was out of priſon, he <hi>aſcended</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Father made him ſit at the <hi>right hand of God in the glory of Majeſty on high,</hi> and he hath given him power and authority to <hi>rule</hi> the world till the day of Judgement. Now in that the Father hath given the Son that <hi>honour</hi> and reſpect in heaven, as to come and ſit at his <hi>right hand,</hi> we may ſee it was not a <hi>breaking</hi> of priſon, but a real paying of the debt, and a fulfilling the law, before he could come there. This may give a little light how the <hi>righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the uſe of it I named in the morning, I was not able to expreſs it, neither can I now fully utter it, I beſeech you conſider the more of it.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:184889:20"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe we may make of it is this, that you ſhould learn from what I have ſaid, where your <hi>juſtification</hi> doth lye, your juſtification doth not lye, or is not built upon any thing that is in you, or that is done by you, or that you may hope to do hereafter; you are not juſtified by your own <hi>perſonal good,</hi> or unjuſtified by your own <hi>perſonal evils,</hi> you are not one jot the more juſt when you have done all the good you can in the world, and you are not one jot the leſs juſt when you have committed all the weakneſſes, and fallen into all the frailties that a Saint can fall into, becauſe your juſtification is built onely upon Chriſt, and upon what he did, and ſuffered. My juſtification is built upon the death of Chriſt, and his reſurrection, he hath fulfilled the law, &amp; he hath paid the debt, and he is out of priſon &amp; the Father is ſatisfied: here is my juſtification; and I believing this, I am happy.</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall finde that you lay a great part of your juſtification upon ſomething in your <hi>ſelves,</hi> therefore when you are enlarged in <hi>good,</hi> then you think you are more juſtified, and when you fall into <hi>ſin,</hi> you think you are more unjuſt then you were before, and you look ſtrangely upon God. Now the Lord hath put it out of our hands. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been juſtified by that that was in <hi>him,</hi> and that ſhould have been <hi>done</hi> by him: but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:184889:21"/> be God, he would not truſt us with that good any more, but hath put all in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, and there is the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our juſtification. Therefore it is not for a Chriſtian to come, and ſay, Sir, I fear I am no childe of God, I fear I ſhall prove an hypocrite: why ſo? becauſe I finde ſo much ſin, and ſo many luſts in me. It is very well that you finde and feel ſin, and that you mourn for, and ſtrive againſt ſin, but that therefore you ſhould think there is a <hi>flaw</hi> in your juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that you ſhould make any good that is in you a <hi>prop</hi> to ſupport your juſtification, or any evil in you a thing that might <hi>crack</hi> your juſtification, this is Popery. My juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation depends not on this, that I am juſtified the more when I am ſtrong, or leſs juſtified when I am weak; but whether I be weak or ſtrong, whether I do much or little for God, whether I give thanks, or be humbled, ſeeing Chriſt is <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>riſen</hi> again, I am juſtified, that is ſtill intire, becauſe it is not built upon <hi>me,</hi> but wholly upon the death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> is laid down as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of believing, <hi>Abraham</hi> had the word of faith, <hi>So ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> and without <hi>hope,</hi> or reaſon, or any thing he believed; that is, he caſt himſelf on that word: ſo it is ſaid he was <hi>juſtified without works.</hi> What a ſtrange thing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:184889:21"/> is that? for it is impoſſible there ſhould be true faith, but that all <hi>good works</hi> ſhould in ſome meaſure follow after: but if we ſpeak properly, and look to the thing as it is in it ſelf, how a man is juſtified, he is juſtified whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>without</hi> works. <hi>Abraham</hi> did many good things, he offered his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his Kinſman when he was in miſery, and did teach his Family, and relieved the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he did many good works; though theſe good works did juſtifie his faith to the world, that they knew he was a believer by it, and he himſelf did know it by it, yet never a one of theſe were an ingredient into the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of his perſon, that was by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God <hi>without</hi> works.</p>
            <p>We muſt get good works after. This is the rule of the word, <hi>Charge them that believe to maintain good works;</hi> that is, after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, charge them to avoid the evil, and do the good, and to abound. But for the point of juſtification, which is the main thing for your Soul and mine to feed on, that is built on another foundation, upon the <hi>grave</hi> of Chriſt, and upon the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt. Therefore you ſhall finde thoſe ſpeeches of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpeaks of this glorious condition, he ſpeaks alway of his union with Chriſt; <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>I am buried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>I am dead, but Chriſt lives in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:184889:22"/>
            <p> Learn this leſſon that you may come to this: for if you had learned it ſpiritually, when you had done the moſt for God, if you could do ten times more then <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet <hi>Paul</hi> preached from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> yet then thou wouldeſt ſay, <hi>I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant;</hi> there is not one grain that I have done that is an ingredient into the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, to help to make me a juſt man, or to procure the favour and love of God. And when you had done <hi>evil,</hi> and it may be failed in careleſneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſin; O what a glorious thing were it to go home, and fall upon thy knees, and ſay, Lord, I have ſinned grievouſly, but yet I am not one jot the <hi>leſs juſt</hi> before thee, becauſe my juſtice, and my righteouſneſs is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon my ſinning, or my unſinning, upon my holineſs, or my unholineſs, but upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Then you would finde by experience your hearts <hi>melt</hi> in pieces, you would be able to look upon ſin in the vaſtneſs, and unkindneſs of it againſt a dear Father; then you would ſee your ſelves the vileſt objects, you would not ſo think or ſpeak of any man in the world as of your ſelves, even for the leaſt frailty. For then the love of God, as oyl working with iron, would preſs your hearts; then you ſhall know, and not before; what it is to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:184889:22"/> truly humbled, and then you ſhall have power to reform; then you would be able to ſay, My ſoul is truly humbled, I can mourn for ſin till I am weary of weeping; then you will be able, though you make not thoſe covenants and reſolutions, there will be ſuch an impreſſion upon the ſoul, that you cannot chuſe but mourn, and loath your ſelves, and avoid the occaſions of ſin, ſeeing your ſelves juſt men in Jeſus Chriſt: for when a man ſees himſelf unjuſt, he can never mourn kindly for ſin, if he ſee God on <hi>Sinai</hi> as a Judge, there will be but untoward mourning for ſin. But when a man ſees the coaſt clear, then he can ſay, I have been the greateſt ſinner in <hi>London;</hi> there is never a childe of God that hath walked more barrenly then I have done, and yet through Chriſt I am as juſt in Gods ſight as any man in <hi>London;</hi> I am Gods childe, but I am an unhappy graceleſs childe: then a man can call himſelf fool, and be angry with himſelf, and weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>
            <p>Now uſually when you mourn for ſin, you think there is a <hi>crack</hi> in your juſtification, and ſo many ſins as you have committed, there are ſo many <hi>flaws</hi> in your juſtification, and ſo many faintings of faith in the favour of God; and therefore when you pray to God, and are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſin, it is your manner, and it was mine moſt of my dayes, onely to dawb up the flaws of juſtification; and you pray the Lord to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:184889:23"/> ſuch a ſin, and now you ſee God is wrath with you, and you are like to be caſt off, and your hearts begin to be hard, and you have ſad thoughts of God ariſing in you, and unquiet and horrour in your ſouls, and you are far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from true ſorrow all this while. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be true ſorrow, when you keep a coile, and confeſs your ſins, and wrangle it out with God, and you will confeſs your ſins to day, and think to make God amends to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and ſo as a man ſtops <hi>chinks</hi> in a wall, we think to dawb up the flaws and cracks of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation this way. Whereas we ſhould look on ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as a thing intire in the hands of Chriſt, that we have nothing to do in, but it is in Chriſt altogether founded on his death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and all the title that we have in it is onely by <hi>faith;</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. ſheweth, <hi>The righteouſneſs of faith ſaith on this wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The word is nigh thee.</hi> There is our title and tenure; I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do for my juſtification, but Chriſt hath fulfilled the law, and he did die, and riſe, and <hi>ſitteth at the right hand of God;</hi> and I endeavour to believe it, that is, to conſent that it is ſo, and praiſe his name, and live to him all the dayes of my life: O here is the life of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen people quarrel with themſelves, and complain, O I have a hard heart, and I deſire the Preachers to pray for me; and when you have fallen into <hi>weakneſs,</hi> you will go and confeſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:184889:23"/> your ſins, and ſtrive to break your hearts, and mourn for your worldlineſs, and your pride, and frowardneſs, and yet it will not do, but your hearts grow harder then they were before: and whereas when you have committed a ſin to day, you think to go and reform to morrow, and to turn over a new leaf, to morrow you will be worſe then to day; becauſe you think to make God amends, he leaves you to your ſelves, and you grow worſe. The reaſon is this, becauſe in ſome ſort, even to this day, you mix ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with juſtification. Now I know it, I ſpeak what I know, could you leave your juſtification alone in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, and look on it (as I ſaid) as Caſh in the cupboard, not to be touched; and as long as Chriſt is righteous, ſay <hi>I am righteous,</hi> behold your ſelves alway as juſt men and women, that in Jeſus Chriſt have fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the law of God, and then you will finde your hearts inclined to any good thing; then would your hearts break and ſhatter to pieces, when you have done the leaſt evil againſt God; then you would know what true ſorrow, and what true repentance is, and not before; then you would know thoſe things that now you know not, nor cannot know. Therefore labour to learn that leſſon, it is one of the greateſt Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the world; and that is the reaſon that carnal people carp at theſe things. What greater Myſtery then for me being a juſt and righteous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:184889:24"/> man through Chriſt, yet to be ſo ſinful, that I can ſay there is none more ſinful, and yet I am as righteous as <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Paul;</hi> in reſpect of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, I have as large a ſhare as <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet I am full of ſin. A Chriſtian knows this, and he knows how it is ſo. Well, that is one leſſon, conſider of it, that you may know where to plant your juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, upon the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. The Lord teach it to you and me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in all that are believers through Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Then, all you that are Saints, all you that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, labour to ſee the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that you are in; that you may be able to reflect upon your ſelves, not according to what you are out of Chriſt, but what you are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be as <hi>Members</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>united</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore you ſhall have <hi>Paul</hi> (and it doth me good to ſee his ſpirit) he never reckons himſelf as in himſelf, but as in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I can do all things, I can want, and I can abound,</hi> I can do this, and that, and all in Chriſt: So, I muſt never conceive of God out of Chriſt, nor of my ſelf out of Chriſt, I muſt never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of my ſelf and Chriſt as <hi>two;</hi> but I ſhould endeavour clearly and conſtantly, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good there is in Chriſt, it is mine, as if it were in mine own perſon. And ſo we ſhould have our ſpirits raiſed above the temptations of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:184889:24"/> the world, and above the afflictions of the world, and above corruptions.</p>
            <p>It is a pitiful thing to ſee poor Profeſſors, there is not one of many, but they are ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low temptations, and they lye under burdens, and are below their ſins: nay, there are many Profeſſors that are more ſad and drooping then carnal people. Surely this was not the way of thoſe Saints that we reade of in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had glorious ſpirits; how do you think elſe they could go to the <hi>Stocks,</hi> and to <hi>Priſons,</hi> and from one <hi>Compter</hi> to another, and have their ſpirits ſo raiſed, and yet ſometimes were to die the next morning for ought they knew? Your ſpirits will never be heightned and raiſed to live the life of <hi>Paul,</hi> by beholding any thing that is in you perſonally in your poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what you are by relation, and marriage to Chriſt. <hi>Reckon your ſelves dead with Chriſt;</hi> and ſo conceive, I am a juſt man, I was bound once to the law of God, a terrible law, and there are thouſands in Hell paying the debt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay it, and yet I have paid every farthing, and the law cannot ask me more. I have offered a perfect righteouſneſs, and I am now ſitting at Gods right hand in Heaven, by my union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is the life of faith, that we may be able to triumph over all theſe things below, from our juſtification, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>It is God that</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:184889:25"/> 
               <hi>juſtifieth, and who ſhall condemn? Who ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more then conquerors through Chriſt that loved us.</hi> Indeed tribulation, and hunger, and famine, they are ſad things, but theſe are the leaſt troubles of a Chriſtian, theſe outward miſeries. Over theſe we are <hi>more then Conquerors,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I can tie my right hand at my back; and with my left hand beat all theſe back; I can beat them with a <hi>finger.</hi> Nay, I ſay more, <hi>Neither death nor life,</hi> that is more, <hi>nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> See there how he dares all the Enemies to come upon the Stage, and tramples them under feet. As in <hi>Malachi</hi> it is ſaid, that in the time of the Goſpel they ſhall tread their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as <hi>aſhes</hi> under their feet. So there is a place alſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> As if he had ſaid, You that have received Jeſus Chriſt, I will tell you news, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory. O Death where is thy ſting? O Grave where is thy victory?</hi> He jeers the grave, and death, and triumphs over them: <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> thou thoughteſt to overcome me, but where is thy ſting? <hi>The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law; but thanks</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:184889:25"/> 
               <hi>be unto God, who hath given us victory through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> He doth not ſay which <hi>will</hi> give us victory when we are dead, and then we ſhall be perfect in Heaven; it is true, then we ſhall be more perfect: but he ſaith, which <hi>hath</hi> given us victory for the preſent, I have already over come Hell, and Death, and the Devil: for all hangs on the <hi>law;</hi> the law is Gods Writ, and the Devil is Gods Sergeant that executes that Writ, and Hell is the Priſon. Therefore if the law be ſatisfied, if the righteouſneſs of the law be fulfilled, Death and Hell, and the Devil have nothing to do with me. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed for our juſtification.</hi> And then it follows, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God.</hi> See where the Apoſtle layes juſtification; <hi>And we glory in tribulation, knowing that it worketh patience,</hi> &amp;c. We rejoice in tribulation and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: Why? becauſe we are <hi>juſtified</hi> by Chriſts death and reſurrection. O what kinde of ſpirits ſhould we have? How full of joy and comfort ſhould we be in the greateſt tribulation? How ſhould we tread all this world under our feet, the evils of this world, and the comforts of the world? How ſhould we inſult and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Devil, and over Death and Hell, for all their power (as I ſaid) is from the law, and if the righteouſneſs of the law be fulfilled, then all our enemies are ſubdued, and all is clear, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:184889:26"/> is open, and God is mine, and the favour of God is to me.</p>
            <p>For know this, that there is no natural inbred hatred in God to his creature; there is nothing that keeps the creature from the full enjoyment of God, but the law not being ſatisfied. God made a law, and we made the breach of it, and there falls out the diſtance between the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and God, whether Men or Devils. Now then, if I can ſay, though I be a ſinful man, yet Jeſus Chriſt hath fulfilled the law, the law hath a full righteouſneſs to a farthing, then I know I am one with God, he is wholly for me, and I for him, and all the enemies of my Salvation are conquered.</p>
            <p>Now if the Lord would open your eyes to underſtand the <hi>hope of your calling,</hi> the glorious condition you are brought into, you would not walk ſo weakly, and poorly, and ſadly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedly, that every thing ſhould caſt you down, but you would go on, and trample all the world under your feet; we ſhould be above men, and Devils, and the world, and every thing, if we did but underſtand to what a glorious eſtate God hath called us in this world, through Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore a man reflecting upon his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as he may look upon himſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelf <hi>ſomething,</hi> ſo he may account Death, and Hell, and all ſubdued, and he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the law cannot demand a farthing of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:184889:26"/> him: That whereas the breach of the law kept us from communion with God, that being taken away, we are as righteous as if we had never fallen. O glorious condition! There <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 1. he prayes that they might <hi>know the riches and hope of their calling;</hi> that is, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what this glorious calling is, that God hath called us to. That is a ſecond Leſſon we ſhould learn hence:</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſeeing the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us, we ſhould learn how to build our Juſtification aright, how to lay the foundation of it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, we ſhould endeavour to get our <hi>ſpirits raiſed</hi> like people that are freed from the law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Thirdly, (and there I ſhall end for this time) being freely and fully juſtified by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, this ſhould follow to any one that underſtands it, that therefore we ſhould ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and learn to <hi>conform</hi> our ſelves in our hearts and lives, out of love to the will of God. There comes in holineſs, and there it comes in amain, and never before; all before is nothing but bungling, but then it comes rightly. We ſhould I ſay conform our ſelves to the Example, and to the Rule of Jeſus Chriſt in his Goſpel. And that you may underſtand that, you muſt know that every man in this world hath a rule to walk by. And there are but three great <hi>Rules,</hi> and all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:184889:27"/> men do, and muſt conform to one of theſe three: for there is no man that doth an action but it is in reference to a Rule.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now you have one Rule in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>As obedient children, not faſhioning your ſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the luſts of your former ignorance:</hi> which ſhews that once they did conform themſelves, they did faſhion themſelves unto their luſts; but ſaith he, now God hath juſtified you, you muſt not conform your ſelves to your luſts. Moſt of mankinde make their luſts their rule, which the Prophet calls in Scripture to do <hi>that which is right in their own eyes:</hi> to do what is their <hi>minde,</hi> what they like in their own minde; and as that worthy Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaith, they think when they are in their beds, what place they ſhall go to, and where they ſhall ſpend their time, and when they are up, they do <hi>that which is right in their own eyes,</hi> what they have a luſt to; when they have a luſt to be drunk, they will be drunk; when they have a luſt to be <hi>filthy,</hi> they will be filthy; when they have a luſt to be <hi>idle,</hi> or a luſt to be <hi>malicious</hi> againſt their neighbours, they will be ſo. So that the ſtirrings of their luſts are their rule, and their whole life is nothing but a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them from one luſt another. Saith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> you muſt not do ſo, but <hi>as obedient children,</hi> if God have juſtified you, if Chriſt have fulfilled the law perfectly for you, that you dare Sin, and Hell, and Satan, and tread all under feet, doth it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:184889:27"/> become you to faſhion your hearts and lives to your luſts? Is that a good rule? no, you muſt not do ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Rule is this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world.</hi> It is the Copy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, the Looking-glaſs that they dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by every day; how to ſquare it in the world, how to keep their port with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Gentlemen they converſe with, and with great men that have command of them, and with their fellow-Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, how they may go brave as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours do, and get credit in their eyes. So moſt people, their main Rule is, they care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it pleaſe God, and conform them to his Son at all, ſo they can keep correſpondency with the world: now you muſt not do ſo, for they are yet in their ſins, poor wretches; therefore let them conform to their luſts, and they that are of the world, let them conform to it: but</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since God hath redeemed you from the wicked world by the blood of his Son, and hath brought you to this condition, and beſtowed glorious and unſpeakable Priviledges on you, you ſhould conform your ſelves to the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the <hi>Rules</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt in the New Teſtament, in all your actions and wayes.</p>
            <p>You cannot write without looking on your Copie, the beſt Saint cannot write one line with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:184889:28"/> viewing and looking on his <hi>Copy</hi> for every letter. For all your actions, you are to have two things in your eye, that you may do the action right, and carry your ſelves right.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either eye Jeſus Chriſt and his <hi>Example,</hi> how would Chriſt have done if he had been here? what did Chriſt do in the like caſe in the Goſpel? So by eying that there will be a power, as in <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſheep by beholding the <hi>rods,</hi> the Spirit of God will convey a power looking upon the picture that is before us, that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to transform us into his likeneſs. Or</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think of the <hi>Rules</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, the Rules of the New Teſtament, this bleſſed Word. Have frequent recourſe to the Spiritual Rules of the New Teſtament, that ſhould be your <hi>Copy.</hi> When any caſe comes, follow not your luſts, and act not according to the <hi>wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> to ſay this or that I will do, but conſider what is your Rule, you walk <hi>by another Rule.</hi> What have I to do what ſuch a man, and ſuch a man doth; but what is <hi>my</hi> Rule? how muſt I carry my ſelf? As for inſtance; when you come among people that rejoice for any mercy, what is the Rule? <hi>Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</hi> It may be a man hath received great unkindneſs, and is wrong'd by him that he hath been moſt kinde to of all the men of the world, and yet he proves moſt ungrateful; if a man ſhould go to <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> he would hate and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:184889:28"/> abhor him, and not indure him; man in his beſt naturals would not bear it, he would not bear ungratefulneſs and wrong, but labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it: But what is the Rule? <hi>The Lord is good to the wicked and unthankeful;</hi> therefore <hi>Lend freely, looking for nothing again.</hi> Preſently, God will bring a Spiritual Rule to your minde, and God will give you power to do it. And ſo, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man ſhould charge and challenge you with a debt, and would you pay ſuch a debt, you perhaps know no ſuch thing, and are perſwaded of the contrary. What now? You know what moſt men think, I will never pay him, I were a fool if I ſhould give away my eſtate, and be a beggar when I have done: but what is the rule? <hi>If thine enemy ſue thee at the law, and take away thy cloke, give him thy coat alſo.</hi> A Chriſtian comes to this law, he <hi>conſults not with fleſh and blood</hi> when a caſe comes, but he thinks what is the rule in this caſe? But all the miſery is, you will be fingering with juſtification, which you ſhould leave alone upon Chriſts death and refurrection, you ſhould be working out your <hi>holineſs</hi> every day, that ſhould be your way, God will bring it in. So when a woman is putting on her clothes, and making her fine clothes, and thinks to be as fine as her neighbours, ſhe ſhould think, but what is <hi>my Rule?</hi> Not to conform my ſelf to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>embroidered hair,</hi> and fine <hi>apparel,</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> but <hi>with the ornament of a meek ſpirit.</hi> So
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:184889:29"/> you have the New Teſtament full: for every caſe there is ſomething that will direct and lead you, that thereby you may conform to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I give you but general inſtances, if God open your eyes to ſee your glorious condition in the New Teſtament, you muſt reſolve on this, to walk according to the <hi>copy</hi> and the rules of it; that in any caſe you may ask, What is my rule as I am a Chriſtian, as I am a free man, one with God, that I may walk by it?</p>
            <p>Now I exhort you to this, becauſe if a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Devils ſhould preach in ſtead of men, and tell you what the Torments of Hell are, all would not be ſo great a motive by half to walk <hi>holily,</hi> as to tell you that <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled by Chriſt,</hi> that you are righteous, and juſt, and all your ſins are done away by Chriſt. Therefore, O love him, and live to him, comform to your <hi>copy.</hi> Let your Neighbours conform to their <hi>copy,</hi> to the World, and others conform to their luſts (as too many do) but do you conform to Jeſus Chriſt. Think, what would Chriſt do if he had my opportunity? what would he have taken in hand? And whatever occaſion you have with God or man, ask, What is my rule in the New Teſtament? and conform to that. Bleſſed is the man or woman to whom God gives a heart ſo to do. There remains one word more of this, and the third Leſſon, which is the principal thing, the <hi>deſcription</hi> of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:184889:29"/> that have this Priviledge; <hi>They walk not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit.</hi> But becauſe the time is gone, and my ſtrength alſo, I ſhall leave that till God give another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               <q>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere were three Leſſons that we may learn from theſe words. The firſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, namely, <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law muſt be fulfilled by every man.</hi> Or, <hi>Every man is bound to fulfill the law of God.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Law of God is perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in all true Believers.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That true Believers are they who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were the laſt time upon the ſecond: we have proved it, and opened the Point, and have made ſome uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that from hence we may learn where our juſtification lieth, and whereon it is built, not upon any thing <hi>in us,</hi> or done <hi>by us,</hi> but only
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:184889:30"/> upon the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hence all that are Saints, all that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould labour to ſee the glorious condition they are in by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ſhould learn (being juſtified <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves in our hearts and lives to the <hi>Example</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and to his <hi>Rules</hi> in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. I ſhall adde but one word more from this Leſſon; that is, that ſeeing <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in them that believe,</hi> you may hence ſee, that none are further from <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm,</hi> then thoſe that are true believers, thoſe that are godly Saints. You have a great ſtir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Antinomians,</hi> what they ſhould be: it is one that is <hi>againſt the law,</hi> that is the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Greek word. Now the queſtion is, Who is moſt <hi>againſt the law of God?</hi> I do not deny but there are ſome, and they may be called <hi>Antinomians</hi> (though we ſhould not miſcall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) yet they deſerve it. But now a Saint that is in Chriſt he is not an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> he is not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law,</hi> becauſe he hath ſatisfied the law: Every man muſt pay the law, and they that would fulfill the law with their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they do the law wrong; they that do moſt here, and they that ſuffer moſt in Hell, they can never ſatisfie the law. But a Chriſtian hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the law, becauſe he hath given it a perfect
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:184889:30"/> righteouſneſs. Now if a man ſhould owe Ten thouſand pounds, and he had but Fifty ſhillings a year coming in, and it may be one year he payes ten ſhillings, another year he payes a Noble, and another year three pence, yet he payes as well as he can. But now ſuppoſe there come a <hi>Surety,</hi> and he payes the whole Ten thouſand pound, and he ſaith to the Creditor, You ſhall be paid no more by <hi>three pences,</hi> but you ſhall receive the whole ſum; what do you think? is not that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? So there are none that ſatisfie the law ſo roundly, and fulfil it ſo perfectly, as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſheth all that is in him, and layes hold on Jeſus Chriſt, and in him payes God to a farthing. Therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> is proving ſtrongly that we are <hi>juſtified by Chriſt,</hi> and not by the law, ſaith he, <hi>We take not away the law, but we eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the law.</hi> This is a better way of fulfilling the law, then any other. All the damned men in Hell, and all the Phariſees on Earth cannot ſatisfie the law, ſo well as one poor ſinner that believes in Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo for matter of practice, a man that believes in Jeſus Chriſt, he walks more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> then any Phariſee can; for he looks not only what is lawful, but what is convenient, he walks by a more ſublime excellent rule. A Phariſee looks only what is lawful, and what is not lawful, but a Chriſtian he looks what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and expedient. Take any man that knows what it is to be juſtified by Chriſt, and that man
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:184889:31"/> goes a thouſand-fold further then another, for a man that would be ſaved by his own fulfilling of the law, if he cannot come up to the law, he will bring the law down to him. As a man that hath a heavy burthen, if it be too heavy for him, he will caſt off ſome of it: ſo when a man goes about to keep the law, and findes it too heavy for him, he will throw away ſome, and cut out a part, and make a carnal groſs law, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep that. Now a man that is juſtified by Chriſt, he knows that the law muſt be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo he takes it in the pureſt ſpirituality, and goes to Chriſt Jeſus, and he hath ſatisfied all. So much briefly for the ſecond Leſſon.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall enter a little upon the third, as far as the Lord ſhall give ſtrength and time. Thoſe that believe, and have this great Priviledge which is the foundation of all others, to have the law <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled for them in Chriſt, they are here deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>walk not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit.</hi> So in the third place take this Doctrine or Leſſon;</p>
            <q>Doct. 3. <hi>That they, and they onely that walk not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are partakers of this Priviledge, to have the benefit of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law of God for them.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I ſay <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they onely</hi> have it, for it excludes all other. The Scripture doth not onely ſet it down poſitively, as it ſaith, <hi>Go, baptize all nations</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:184889:31"/> 
               <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> therefore we may conclude thence that we may baptize thoſe that are <hi>diſciples:</hi> but from that place to gather this Doctrine, That <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they onely</hi> are to be baptized, cannot be right; but here I ſay, it is <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they onely.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe we ſee after, <hi>thoſe that walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh ſhall die,</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſs of the law</hi> is not fulfilled for them, for then they ſhould never die, nor be damned: they that <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>they onely</hi> have this Priviledge. Now the main buſineſs that I ſhall endeavour at this time, will be onely to open to you theſe two words.</p>
            <p>What i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is to <hi>walk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is meant by <hi>fleſh,</hi> and what by <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if we underſtand what it is to <hi>walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh,</hi> we ſhall eaſily underſtand what it is to <hi>walk according to the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the former word, to <hi>walk,</hi> I ſhall ſay but little, becauſe you underſtand it. To <hi>walk</hi> is a general word in this place, it is of a great extent, and comprehends a mans whole courſe, and way, and practice. A man who goes, or converſeth, whoſe courſe and way is according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> (whatſoever that fleſh is, as we ſhall ſee afterwards) ſuch a man <hi>walks.</hi> Therefore it is oft ſet down in Scripture by ſeveral expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>They that are after the law,</hi> and <hi>they of the conciſion,</hi> &amp;c. Put what words you will ſo they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:184889:32"/> be general enough, they whoſe thoughts, and words, and courſes are that way, they are they that are ſaid to <hi>walk.</hi> There are three words in the Original for <hi>walking,</hi> and of thoſe three, the word here is of the <hi>largeſt extent.</hi> To <hi>walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh,</hi> what is the meaning of that? I ſhall be a little larger in opening of this, I will not trouble you with the various acceptations of the word <hi>fleſh.</hi> You know there is a literal ſenſe of it, and by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> it is put for the whole perſon, <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and there is a <hi>Metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> acceptatoin of <hi>fleſh, I will give them a heart of fleſh;</hi> it is called <hi>fleſh</hi> for ſoftneſs: and there is a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> acceptation of <hi>fleſh,</hi> a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kinde of ſpeech; and ſo it is to be underſtood in this place. Now to open this to you, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, in <hi>general</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>what is meant by <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>particularly</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>By <hi>fleſh</hi> therefore in general, you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in this place and the like, <hi>every thing,</hi> let it be what it will be, that is <hi>againſt Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Spirit,</hi> or his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> or any thing elſe that belongs to it, any thing that is not of faith, or of Chriſt, is it <hi>fleſh</hi> in general. Let me ſpeak more plainly, Any thing that is of <hi>Old Adam</hi> is fleſh, whether it be good or evil, and any thing that is of and from the <hi>New Adam,</hi> that is <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now you know we receive two things from <hi>Old Adam;</hi> ſome natural, moral <hi>good,</hi> ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:184889:32"/> of that that he had the fulneſs of; and we receive <hi>evil,</hi> when he was corrupted. Now both theſe, take them in the largeſt extent, they are both called <hi>fleſh</hi> in Scripture, whatſoever is of, or comes from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> is called fleſh, therefore fleſh in many places in the New Teſtament it is the very ſame with the <hi>old man,</hi> and you have them taken promiſcuouſly, <hi>Our old man is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Rom. 6. And in another place, <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh,</hi> not onely the corruption or evil, that <hi>Original ſin</hi> (as we ſay) that is <hi>within us,</hi> but whatſoever of the image of the old man is <hi>upon us;</hi> whatſoever we have had, whether it be good or evil, from the <hi>old man.</hi> And indeed in the New Teſtament it is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken for the moral good of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> then the evil, though it be taken for both yet I ſay moſt frequently the good of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the wiſdom of <hi>Old Adam; The wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God,</hi> Rom. 8. as in the <hi>New Adam</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the holy Ghoſt is a moſt excellent piece, ſo the wiſdome of <hi>Old Adam</hi> is the unhappieſt, and moſt miſerable thing of all.</p>
            <p>That you may underſtand this, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that all the principles of this world, I mean of all Mankinde, all their motions and actions do wholly ſpring and flow from two roots, two principles; as the Heathen Philoſophers ſaid in another ſenſe, they held that all this world did
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:184889:33"/> riſe from <hi>two Beginnings,</hi> from <hi>two Beings,</hi> from <hi>two Principles;</hi> there was one good and another evil, that ſet all things on work: ſo all things in every man in this world, the principles, and motions, and actions, and thoughts, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wiſdome, and reaſoning, and doing, whatſoever is within or without man, ſprings from one of theſe two roots; that is, it is either from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mean not nature in you but) it flows from <hi>Adam</hi> that was once in Paradiſe, or elſe from the <hi>New Adam</hi> Chriſt Jeſus: for there were but two men that ever in the world were publick perſons, that were the Fountain of the principles and proceedings of Mankinde; <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, natural <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Spiritual <hi>Adam.</hi> All Mankinde was made after the Image of the firſt <hi>Adam: We have born the image of the earthly Adam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. and indeed all the Saints ſhall bear the image of the heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> too, hereafter at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Now both theſe <hi>Adams</hi> are as two Springs in a hill, conveying their ſtreams to two rivers; they are ſprings from whence ariſe all the thoughts, and imaginations, and actions, and proceedings, all the wiſdome and righteouſneſs, whatſoever is in us, it ſprings either from the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus planted in the Soul, or elſe it flows from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> from natural <hi>Adam</hi> that is in us: therefore they are called
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:184889:33"/> the roots; the Lord Jeſus is called <hi>the root of Jeſſe.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe all the new Creation, all the work of grace, all the principles, &amp; thoughts and actions of a Saint, ſo far as they are of grace, they riſe from the <hi>New Adam</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore, I ſay, to underſtand this a little in general, before I go further. A man that <hi>walks according to the fleſh,</hi> who is he? A man that walks according to any thing of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> whether it be good or evil. And uſually in the New Teſtament it is taken for the good, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. there <hi>fleſh</hi> is taken for the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> when a man walks according to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to natural wiſdome, and according to the righteouſneſs of <hi>Old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> that is done by us; or when we walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſins, and luſts, and corruptions of <hi>Adam;</hi> for both are put together, and all makes but fleſh, and whole fleſh ſtrives againſt whole Spirit. Now I ſay, take it in a general ſenſe, to <hi>walk after the fleſh,</hi> is not onely to walk ſinfully, and carnally, but when a man walks, though devoutly and righteouſly in the eye of the world, yet if it be after the principles of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> if he do not walk by a principle planted in him from the <hi>New Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, all this is but fleſh.</p>
            <p>Now then for a man to <hi>walk according to the Spirit;</hi> What is that? All his principles ſpring from the root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> from the Spirit of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:184889:34"/> Lord Jeſus; all his actions are upon another ground. Now, I ſay, all the principles and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of every man and woman in the world, ſprings from one of theſe: therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and neceſſary that you conſider how the two <hi>Adams</hi> are the two Springs of all Mankinde, the two pillars (as it were) upon which God hath laid all Mankinde, and all that is done in the world, and thoſe that walk after the one, walk after the fleſh, and thoſe that are after the other walk after the Spirit. So much in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
            <p>Now more particularly, by <hi>walking after the fleſh,</hi> in this place, there are three things meant.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing meant by <hi>walking after the fleſh,</hi> according as moſt of our godly and learned tranſlate it, is when a man walks according to the dictates and ſuggeſtions of corrupt nature. So fleſh is taken for Original ſin, that is, that corruption of nature that is prone to every evil, and that is an enemy to all good. So a man that <hi>walks according to the fleſh,</hi> is when the courſe and bent of a mans ſoul and life goes after ſin, though he do ſome good ſometimes, yet when his courſe is that way, that is, his continuedneſs and contentedneſs is after ſin, this is to <hi>walk after the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, when it is his <hi>continued</hi> courſe: for <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is not a ſtep, or a leap, or a ſtride, but walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a thing of <hi>many paces.</hi> So it is called <hi>a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:184889:34"/> 
               <hi>from iniquity to iniquity,</hi> Rom. 6.</p>
            <p>And then there is in walking <hi>contentedneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs:</hi> a man is not ſaid to walk when he is tired, or when he goes in danger, but walking it pleaſant to all, young and old. So when he ſaith they that <hi>walk according to the fleſh,</hi> that is, not onely when men are overtaken by luſts and ſin, but people that in their ordinary courſe go with a great deal of contentment in evil wayes.</p>
            <p>But, though this be true, that this is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in <hi>walking after the fleſh,</hi> yet this is very lame, and ſhort, of the full and whole meaning of this place. I ſay it is not the main nor chief meaning of this place, it is not primarily, not principally meant: this is a truth, and it will follow as a neceſſary conſequence, as I ſhall ſhew anon, and I doubt not but the Apoſtle means it, when he ſaith, <hi>We walk not according to the fleſh,</hi> becauſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. he takes a great deal of pains in that point; but I think this is not the chief meaning. My Reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe I finde that the very ſcope of this learned Epiſtle is <hi>different,</hi> if not almoſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to this, his ſcope is not to quarrel with them for want of doing good works, and for walking in ſinful works, but the ſcope of it is, to beat them off from their own works, and to bring them to Chriſt, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was juſtified without works;</hi> he all along diſparageth their works as they did them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:184889:35"/> I think he doth not go ſo far from his text, or from his ſcope, as to make this the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, their ſanctification or holineſs, the not walking in evil, or the walking in good works.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this cannot be the chief ſcope of the place; becauſe if you take theſe words, <hi>They that walk after the fleſh,</hi> in this ſenſe, that is, thoſe that follow ſinful courſes, if you take them ſo, that none but ſuch as walk <hi>holily</hi> have a right to Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſs: Or if you take them in this ſenſe, that they onely that walk in a holy life can come to know that they have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt fulfilling the law for them, neither of theſe can hold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, that <hi>no</hi> man can have to do with Chriſt or his righteouſneſs, but that man that <hi>walks according to the Spirit,</hi> that walks in a holy way, and not in ſinful courſes, this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſtream of the Goſpel. Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpel all along offers Chriſt to <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> to the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> to <hi>aliens,</hi> and to the <hi>ungodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Then again if this were ſo, ſanctification ſhould be before juſtification, a man muſt be <hi>holy</hi> before he ſhould be <hi>juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the latter ſenſe, to wit, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhould mean this, that no man can know any other way that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt did belong to him, but onely by not walking after the fleſh, or by walking after the Spirit; this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:184889:35"/> cannot be neither: for however we may know a little in a way of ſenſe by our walking, yet the main way to know our juſtification, is the ſame way that we come by juſtification; for, <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> The main evidence whereby I know I am juſtified, is becauſe the <hi>word of faith</hi> ſaith ſo, the <hi>word</hi> tells me, and <hi>faith</hi> evidenceth it: that faith that I believe by, it ſhews me that I believe. Therefore though I be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in my way of grace, that to ſenſe ſhews me a little, yet it doth not ſolely, and chiefly, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily. So that this is the ſubſtance of it, that that <hi>ſenſe</hi> which godly reverend men give of this place, it is <hi>true,</hi> but it is not <hi>all,</hi> nor the firſt, and the chief part of the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>fleſh</hi> in the Scriptures, and ſo here and in divers other places, it may be underſtood concerning the <hi>Priviledges,</hi> thoſe various <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> that the people of God, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had in a natural, fleſhly way, from generation to generation. Being born of ſuch Parents, of ſuch <hi>Tribes,</hi> they had ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges belonging to them, they had the <hi>Oracles, and the Covenants, and the Tables,</hi> &amp;c. and this is called <hi>fleſh:</hi> and I doubt not but the Apoſtle had this in his eye. Saith he, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us that walk not after the fleſh:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Do not think becauſe you are of the <hi>ſeed of Abraham,</hi> or becauſe you have the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and that you are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:184889:36"/> born of ſuch Parents, that therefore you ſhall the ſooner have this priviledge to have the <hi>law fulfilled,</hi> take heed of that, for now it ſprings from another root, and it comes now in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and not in a fleſhly way as it did before: for they had their mercies generally in the Old Teſtament according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>Iſaac</hi> as he was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son, and <hi>Jacob</hi> his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now it is in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> way.</p>
            <p>Now that fleſh is ſo taken in Scripture, I will give you that one place, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, If any man thinketh that he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more.</hi> What doth he mean by fleſh here? He tells you, <hi>Circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the Tribe of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law a Phariſee; concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church; touching the righteouſneſs which is in the law, blameleſs.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I had all the priviledges, if any man might boaſt in the fleſh, I might, I am <hi>an Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the beſt deſcent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>Seeing that many glory after the fleſh, I will glory alſo, ye ſuffer fools gladly. Wherein any is bold, I am bold alſo. Are they Hebrews? ſo am I. Are they Iſraelites? ſo am I. Are they the ſeed of Abraham? ſo am I.</hi> They had priviledges being <hi>Iſraelites</hi> more then other people, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fleſh. So I am confident that the Apoſtle had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:184889:36"/> this in his eye, in a ſpecial manner, when he ſaith, <hi>They that walk not according to the fleſh.</hi> And you ſhall finde that they attributed all priviledges to them becauſe they were <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> as you ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. ſay they, <hi>We are the children of Abraham;</hi> Saith <hi>John Baptiſt, Ye are a generation of Vipers.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. ſay they, <hi>We are free men, we are the ſons of Abraham,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil.</hi> See, the Goſpel takes away that fleſhlineſs, and puts all in another ſtream, and courſe, and way. The Apoſtle aims at that here, when he ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that walk not according to the fleſh.</hi> As if he had ſaid, You ſhall never have this righteouſneſs to ſatisfie the law the ſooner becauſe you are the Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> no more then if you were <hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, the main and chief mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this place is this, though the other be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that walk not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> By fleſh, here the Apoſtle means walking according to the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> according to the Covenant of Works in the way of the law: and by Spirit, is meant walking in the way of <hi>faith,</hi> or in the way of the Goſpel, or in the way of Chriſt. There be divers expreſſions in Scripture that help us to underſtand it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 14. it is called, <hi>They that are of the law,</hi> that is, thoſe that walk according to the law. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. there are two or three phraſes, <hi>Received ye the Spirit</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:184889:37"/> 
               <hi>by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> The walking according to the Spirit is <hi>the hearing of faith;</hi> and it is twice there, <hi>they that are of faith, they that are of faith.</hi> To <hi>be of faith,</hi> and to <hi>walk according to the Spirit,</hi> is the ſame; to be of the law, or of circumciſion, is to walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>The righteouſneſs which is of the law ſaith on this wiſe.</hi> The <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of the law, that is, the <hi>way</hi> of the law: that Scripture ſets out the way of thoſe that walk according to the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> now the way of the law is the ſame as <hi>walking after the fleſh:</hi> and faith he, <hi>The righteouſneſs of faith ſaith on this wiſe;</hi> that is, the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or the way of faith. So the meaning is this, we hear of a glorious priviledge that the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in us,</hi> and there is no man in the world can get it by his own works, or in reference to the Covenant of works, no not <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, but it is meerly by Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore if any of you think to have this <hi>righteouſneſs fulfilled in him,</hi> and go in the old way, to <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> to the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> he is deceived, he ſhall never have it, but by <hi>walking according to the Spirit:</hi> no man can enjoy this priviledge by a Covenant of works, by their own doing, by ſeeking to fulfil the law of God by their own righteouſneſs, but they <hi>that walk after the Spirit:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Do not miſtake me, it is a great priviledge to have the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:184889:37"/> law fulfilled for you, but it is not by your own ſtrictneſs and zeal: and though ſome of you go further then others, yet none of you can attain the fulfilling of the law that way; for <hi>all are come ſhort,</hi> Rom. 3. But it is thoſe that walk after the Spirit, that is, thoſe that ſeek it in a way of faith in another, not in themſelves, thoſe that ſeek it according to the principles and directions of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe I know this Expoſitions is harſh to many of you, (though I exclude not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) therefore I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will prove clearly out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that this is the meaning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will give you a Reaſon why that is the chief meaning.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall give you a few Reaſons why the Apoſtle ſaith that they that walk according to the Covenant of works, walk according to the fleſh, and they that go according to the way of faith, walk according to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, that fleſh is often taken clearly in this ſenſe, I will give you ſome places of Scripture: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>This I would learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye ſo fooliſh, that having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect in the Fleſh?</hi> We ſee in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. they are called to the grace of Chriſt through the Goſpel,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:184889:38"/> 
               <hi>Goſpel principles</hi> were rightly and ſavingly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed among them, and after there came ſome among them that perverted them; and ſaith he, <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, that having begun in the Spirit,</hi> and have had <hi>Chriſt crucified among you,</hi> that <hi>now you will be made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> that now you will go and ſeek juſtification by your <hi>own works,</hi> and go about to keep the law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another place is in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh,</hi> and then he ſpeaks of the priviledges of an <hi>Iſraelite:</hi> and if you look further, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>I count all theſe loſs that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Chriſt.</hi> So by the fleſh he means <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law,</hi> which he throws away for the <hi>righteouſneſs which is of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take another place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> When you were under the law, and walked after the fleſh, ſin had dominion over you, and you obeyed it. Here is a parallel place: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>When you were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin by the law did work in your members.</hi> When you were in the fleſh, that is, when you were <hi>under the law,</hi> then the <hi>motions of ſin did work:</hi> but now <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, becauſe you are not under the law;</hi> you are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:184889:38"/> not in the fleſh, you do not walk according to the fleſh. And that I ſuppoſe is the meaning of that Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly, and to reſerve the wicked to be puniſhed; but chiefly thoſe that walk after the fleſh, in the luſts of uncleanneſs.</hi> Now if you take walking after the fleſh for ſinful wayes, it would be the ſame as if he had ſaid, There are divers people that walk wickedly, but chiefly they that walk after the fleſh; for all people naturally walk after the fleſh: but theſe were a peculiar people that the Lord would bring judgements on; and they walked according to the fleſh. Who were they? They were moſt of them <hi>Jews,</hi> they were <hi>Adams</hi> ſons, that walked in the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, chiefly they that walk according to the fleſh; that is the meaning of it, or elſe he would not have ſaid <hi>according</hi> to the fleſh: for every man naturally walks according to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>So in this Text, <hi>Who walk not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit;</hi> and in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. of this Chapter, <hi>They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Now I ſhall open that by another Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. where it ſaid that <hi>Enoch pleaſed God.</hi> We reade of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5. 24. that he <hi>walked with God;</hi> he walked not according to the fleſh: now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> now he that walks in the fleſh <hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Why ſo? He that goes not in the way of faith by Jeſus
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:184889:39"/> Chriſt, he cannot pleaſe God. By <hi>believing</hi> I pleaſe God, by walking in the obedience of faith to God, I and my works pleaſe God. Now to pleaſe, implies one was offended before: all my <hi>doing</hi> cannot pleaſe God, but my <hi>believing,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to God a perfect righteouſneſs by faith, pleaſeth God, and then all my works are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There are two words for it in the Original; one ſignifies to pleaſe one that hath been offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; another is, <hi>pleaſingneſs</hi> with one that hath <hi>not</hi> offended: as my childe pleaſeth me though he have not offended me; but the other is to be pleaſed with one that was an Enemy before, one that was againſt me, that is now received to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. So I have told you briefly ſome Scriptures to ſhew you that the fleſh is taken in this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Now the main Reaſon of it, why I believe this to be the <hi>chief</hi> meaning of it, is becauſe that I ſee clearly that this is the chief drift and ſcope of this Epiſtle, and if I may ſpeak without diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, there is nothing more methodically laid down; and this is ſpoken to bring them from the <hi>way of works</hi> to the <hi>way of faith.</hi> But I haſten.</p>
            <p>Why doth the holy Ghoſt call walking after the Covenant of Works, and after the law, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the fleſh, and the other walking after the Spirit?</p>
            <p>The Reaſon is, Becauſe there is ſo great affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nearneſs between walking <hi>legally,</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:184889:39"/> walking <hi>ſinfully,</hi> that they are promiſcuouſly in Scripture taken one for another. For let a man walk, and endeavour, and do his beſt, according to the Law, and not by the Goſpel, he ſhall be ſure to walk ſinfully and carnally; there is no help for it. If he be <hi>under the law,</hi> ſin will have dominion over him: and if he go after the fleſh, the motions of the fleſh will bring forth <hi>fruit unto death.</hi> Sin and the law are (as it were) of ſo near a kin, that the law makes ſin more ſinful, and the more a man ſtrives to keep the law, the more he ſins. The Apoſtle brought it ſo near, that people were ready to ſpeak non-ſenſe, that the law was ſin. He prevents the objection, <hi>Is the law ſin?</hi> O no, faith he, <hi>ſin is the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the law.</hi> So that a man that walks accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the law, and not according to the way of the Goſpel, in ſpight of his heart he ſhall walk according to the fleſh, that is, according to the luſts of nature, he can never walk holily, let him do what he can.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon why it is called fleſh, is in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the two Sons of <hi>Abraham;</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21. The Apoſtle there, ſpeaking of theſe two Covenants, he ſaith, <hi>Abraham had two ſons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman: but he who was of the bond-woman was born after the fleſh, but he of the free woman was by promiſe, which things are an allegory</hi> (or a compariſon) <hi>for theſe are the two Covenants, the one from mount</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:184889:40"/> 
               <hi>Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar, for this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to Jeruſalem which now is, and is in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with her children: but Jeruſalem which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove is free, which is the mother of us all.</hi> He is proving that the old Covenant was to be done away, <hi>Agar</hi> was to be thrown out with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He proves that thoſe two Sons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> were types of the two Covenants that God made with mankinde, the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> Now the Covenant of Works he compares to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> that was born after the fleſh, as other children were, <hi>Abraham</hi> went in to <hi>Hagar,</hi> and ſhe conceived, and bare a childe as other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: but <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not born after the fleſh, all fleſhly wayes could not produce <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was a childe of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the Spirit of God breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the promiſe, and working mightily in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Iſaac</hi> was produced. This is an Allegory, there is a great Myſterie that you think not of, when you reade of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac.</hi> By <hi>Iſhmael</hi> is meant the Covenant of Works, and the principles of it, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of it, and they walk according to the fleſh, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did: and by <hi>Iſaac</hi> is meant the Covenant of Grace; and thoſe that go that way are children of the promiſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was. So God hath ſet this Compariſon, and I conceive the Apoſtle alludes to it, and calls it a <hi>walking</hi>

               <hi>according to the fleſh.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Thou ſhalt never have this righteouſneſs by walking in the way of thy father <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> by Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> by walking in the law to turn away the wrath of God; but if thou wilt get this righteouſneſs, thou muſt walk according to the Spirit, thou muſt get the Spirit, and be a childe of promiſe.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Reaſon that I ſhall give, why it is called <hi>walking according to the Fleſh,</hi> is becauſe of weakneſs: for fleſh is put for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>They are Fleſh, and not Spirit,</hi> that is, they are poor weak things: ſo, thoſe that walk in that way, in the way of the law, they are weak creatures; there is nothing but wiſhing, and woulding, and covenanting, and promiſing, and proteſting, and vexing, and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but there is no ſtrength. Now one Saint that is truly planted in Chriſt, and the Goſpel hath truly taken place in his heart, he hath more ſtrength then five hundred of the other. Saith <hi>Paul, I can do all things,</hi> I can want, and I can abound, I can go to priſon freely, I can <hi>rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and mourn with them that mourn.</hi> Becauſe the ſame Spirit that dwells in Chriſt, and works effectually, the ſame Spirit dwells in us, and works in us. Therefore that is the meaning of it, They that <hi>walk</hi> after the fleſh, that is, they that go after the law, they are weak, they tug, and are never the nearer Heaven; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:184889:41"/> if they ſhould live a thouſand years they would be no better, but wiſhers, and woulders, and ſay I have a good deſire to do as the Preacher ſaith, but I have no power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let me conclude with one word of Uſe, from all this that hath been ſaid, which I hope you will conſider of. From this Doctrine thus opened, you may hence ſee the ſaying of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt verified, and made good, that <hi>few ſhall enter into the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Paul</hi> did not look on ſinners and Saints as we do: we account every Profeſſor, let his principles be what they will, either from the firſt or ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> if he begin to leave ſin, and to perform duties, we account him a good man. But when the Lord comes to judge, he will look further, and examine us, and will (I fear) finde abundance that ſhall never enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, even of thoſe that follow <hi>good old Adam,</hi> I mean there are abundance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that have left corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> in his groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and follow good old <hi>Adam</hi> that is a ſprig from that; they will abſtain from ſins, and they will perform duties, and they will do no wrong, and all is but <hi>old Adam</hi> ſtill.</p>
            <p>Therefore you that are Profeſſors, look to your ſelves for the Lords ſake, I am miſtaken if there be not many hundreds of us that will be found the Sons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> at the laſt day; many that make a great Profeſſion, and many that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:184889:41"/> make a greater Profeſſion then others, that are honeſt ſpiritual Saints before the world, before men: for when a man goes to keep the law, every light that comes into his ſoul intends his reſolution, every thing intends it in that courſe he is in; and he may go to the higheſt, and be the greateſt Profeſſor, and be ready for all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet be found a ſtranger to Jeſus Chriſt: therefore look to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>I remember Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> that bleſſed man, he divides the World for the <hi>fewneſs</hi> of them that ſhall be ſaved; ſaith he, the greateſt part of the World, two, or three parts of it are moſt intire <hi>Heathens:</hi> In <hi>Europe</hi> here we have the moſt part <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and but a few that are <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and among thoſe parts there are few that <hi>profeſs</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and among thoſe that profeſs Religion, there are very few that do it in truth: as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly man ſaith; take a multitude of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that have been bred under the law, that have been bred on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> take a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſuch Profeſſors (as there be many ſuch in <hi>England)</hi> and let the Goſpel come and be Preached rightly among them, to tranſlate them, let a Miniſter of the Goſpel come and ſay there is <hi>no damnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and you are <hi>juſtified freely,</hi> and Chriſt hath <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the law,</hi> and all is clear; whereas before there were fears leſt they were not righteous, and they did work hard, now let a man labour
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:184889:42"/> to draw them to the Goſpel, and to plant Chriſt and the principles of Chriſt in their hearts, and I fear that there is not one in ten but will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in the <hi>removing,</hi> as you finde it often with your Trees when you remove and tranſplant them. I ſay abundance of thoſe Profeſſors will come to nothing; for when the fear of Hell and damnation is gone from their Conſcience, when the Whip is gone, they will <hi>turn the grace of God into wantonneſs.</hi> Nay, ſome will turn down-right enemies, and perſecutors of the Goſpel, as the Phariſees; and of thoſe that would come in, in all probability, in removing and tranſlating them from the law to the Goſpel, there is not one in ten but would <hi>turn the grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and there goes all their Religion. The way to Heaven is <hi>narrow,</hi> our Lord Chriſt ſaith, and I think it will be found far more narrow then we conceive of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore as another godly man ſaith, we are exceedingly miſtaken in judging of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, we look upon them, and thoſe that begin to amend from their ſins, we call them <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> But this is the true way of judging, that there are but <hi>two Roots</hi> in the world, the <hi>Old Adam,</hi> and the <hi>New Adam;</hi> there are but <hi>two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Sinai,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> there are but <hi>two</hi> wayes of walking, After the fleſh, and after the Spirit, after the Law, and after the Goſpel. Now I judge him to be a Saint, and a Believer, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:184889:42"/> God calls and owns him as a Saint, though he be weak, and be not ſo glorious in the eye of the world, as many formal Profeſſors, yet if I ſee any principles of the Goſpel in him, if there be a little of Chriſt in him in power, though it be but in a little meaſure, and he can pray but a little, and he cannot keep Faſting dayes, and dayes of Humiliation ſo plauſibly (as many that make a trade of it in this City) yet if that prayer, and repeating, and reading, and hearing, or preaching, or whatſoever it be, if it flow from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a natural man knows natural things, ſo one Saint knows another, the <hi>Spirit of God knows the things of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, we all of us have a great deal of fleſh, and there is ſomewhat of <hi>good old Adam,</hi> as well as of <hi>corrupted Adam;</hi> but ſurely we ought not to conceive him to be a Saint, let him be never ſo glorious in the eye of the world, and in the performance of duties, if there be not ſomewhat of Chriſt in him. You may ſee a poor deſpicable creature, and ſee a great deal of Chriſt in him; and on the other ſide, you may ſee great Profeſſors that are <hi>Ringleaders</hi> of others, and yet there is not one jot of Chriſt in them, but all is <hi>Old Adam,</hi> ſcrewed up in his brave parts, and all is but fleſh a little more refined; and he that is fleſh, and all that is fleſh, <hi>cannot inherit the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look to your ſelves ſeriouſly, eſpecially you
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:184889:43"/> that are moſt eminent, that think beſt of your ſelves, that are ancient Profeſſors, unleſs you look to your ſelves, you may take a great deal of pains, and when all comes to all, after all your praying, and faſting, and repeating, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you may be found to be nothing in the world but men that walk according to the fleſh, that is, according to the refined and well educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principles of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> you may be <hi>Iſhmaels,</hi> and be built upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> when all is done.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay we may hence learn to judge rightly of perſons, who are Saints, and who are not, who are the children of God, and who are not. For in moſt things we do not judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we do not judge as God judgeth. We uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge of men and things, according to natural wiſdome, or according to ſome diſtinctions and definitions that we have of things, in that <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral divinity</hi> we have. As for inſtance: If a man leave his drunkenneſs and whoredome, and come up to ſome kinde of holineſs in his life, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, if he come to hear Sermons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them, and pray a little in his Family, that man we call a Saint, a godly man, and it may be he may be ſo, and it may be not ſo. Now the way that God judgeth of all men, is as they are children either of the <hi>Old,</hi> or of the <hi>New Adam,</hi> and not according to ſuch a proportion of ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their lives: for the Phariſees went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond many weak Profeſſors, in common righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:184889:43"/>
            <p> And this ſhould be a main ground of our communion, and fellowſhip, and delight in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether in Churches or otherwiſe. It ſhould not be grounded on this, If ſuch a man be of my opinion in ſuch things, if he agree with me, he is for me; and another that agrees with another, he is for him. Theſe kinde of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions will prove nothing but Faction in the end. But the true Communion is, when Saints toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep Fellowſhip, Church-fellowſhip or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon Spiritual grounds; that is, when Chriſt in <hi>his</hi> Soul, and Chriſt in <hi>mine</hi> cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: this is the main ground that makes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Fellowſhip, whatſoever comes in beſides that is additional, but if there be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of people without this, I ſay it will prove but Faction, but walking according to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>I ſhould ſhew now what courſe we ſhould take to bring our ſelves to Spiritual walking.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, what they ſhould do that God hath brought up in ſome meaſure to this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I leave that till God give another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>

               <q>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere were three Leſſons that the Lord did teach us from theſe words. The firſt is implied in the beginning of the Verſe; <hi>That every man is bound to get him a righteouſneſs to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law of God.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That all thoſe that rightly believe in Chriſt have in them a righteouſneſs perfectly to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That thoſe that thus believe, and have this great priviledge (for it is the foundation of all others) they are known or deſcribed by this, They walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two former I have finiſhed, I entred upon the third the laſt day; I opened it at large, and proved it to you, and came to make one Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. That from hence we may learn how to judge of <hi>perſons,</hi> how to judge of thoſe that are Saints, and thoſe that are not Saints, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome kinde of holineſs they may come up to, but according to the principles they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:184889:44"/> walk by, either as they walk according to the fleſh, or according to the Spirit. For I told you there be divers Profeſſors among us, that it may be are eminent in the eye of the world, before men, yet when all comes to all, their faſting, and praying, and preaching, and repeating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be found to be nothing in the world but a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the fleſh, that is, according to the refined, well educated principles of <hi>Old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> But I ſhall go on a little further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Therefore in the next place, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will be; <hi>How ſhall I know whether I walk according to the fleſh, or according to the Spirit? How ſhall I know whether I be one of thoſe that walk according to the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will onely give you a few Expreſſions of it; (I will not ſay <hi>ſigns,</hi> for it may be you could not all bear that word) and theſe expreſſions are moſt of them laid down in this Chapter, and hereabout: whereby you may have a gueſs of it, whether you be the men that walk according to the Spirit, or no.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you ſhall finde in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. that thoſe that are <hi>under grace,</hi> or that walk according to the Spirit, ſin is deſtroyed in them, they are <hi>dead to ſin, and alive to righteouſneſs.</hi> And there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expreſſions of the ſame thing in divers phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; as in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> If thou
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:184889:45"/> be a man that <hi>walkeſt according to the Spirit,</hi> thou canſt ſay <hi>the body of ſin is deſtroyed,</hi> and thou doſt not ſerve ſin. Then it is ſaid in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that thoſe that are under grace, they are <hi>dead indeed to ſin, and alive to God:</hi> that is another expreſſion. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Sin ſhall not reign in their mortal bodies, that they ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Yield not your members as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over them.</hi> So, there are divers expreſſions of one and the ſame thing. Now from all (for I cannot open them particularly, how much is held forth in each of theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but to help thee to ſee a little the ſtate of thy Soul) I would gather theſe three things from all theſe expreſſions; there is I ſay meant by them theſe three things.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing is this, That thoſe that walk according to grace, and according to the Spirit, <hi>ſin is dead in them;</hi> that is, they are dead in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the guilt of ſin, they do ſee and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in ſome meaſure, that Jeſus Chriſt by his death hath aboliſhed, and deſtroyed, and done away all their ſins, in reſpect of the guilt of them; they are not under the law in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. They ſee that there is a full righteouſneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, that hath ſatisfied the law, and ſo their ſins are done away, that they ſhall never condemn them. This is one thing.</p>
            <p>Now a man that walks according to the fleſh,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:184889:45"/> he ſees not that, neither can ſee it; for theſe things are ſpiritual. Now take a man that walks according to the fleſh, that is, according to the moſt refined principles of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way carries guilt upon his Conſcience, he will alway be as a man that is rolling of a Snow-ball, the more he goes on in his ſervice, the more guilt and horrour. But a man that walks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, let him be weak or ſtrong, he ſees this in ſome meaſure (and probably for the moſt part) that his ſins are done away, and that there is no condemnation to him, becauſe he is in Chriſt, and believes in him: therefore as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>He that is dead is freed from ſin,</hi> or juſtified from ſin. That is one thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in all theſe phraſes this is held forth to us (as I underſtand) that a believer being planted into Chriſt (for ſo he looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) and ingrafted and united to Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the power of ſin he accounts it as <hi>dead;</hi> that is, when he ſees any ſin ſtirring in him, he conſiders, I am one with Chriſt, I am planted with him in his death and reſurrection, and this ſin was condemned when Chriſt was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as ſure as Chriſt did die, this ſin muſt die; therefore he looks upon all his ſins and luſts, as things that are gaſping for life, as things that are ready to die, and that will ſurely die, as ſurely as Chriſt did die.</p>
            <p>Another man that walks according to the law,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:184889:46"/> when he ſees ſin in him, and findes luſts to riſe in his ſoul, he ſaith as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Surely I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul;</hi> Surely I ſhall prove an Hypocrite one time or other, this ſin will break my neck, and ſo he is diſcouraged, and his heart is hardened. But a man that is under grace, that walks according to the Goſpel, let ſin be never ſo ſtrong and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he looks on it as a condemned thing, he can triumph over it when it is ſtrongeſt, and can ſay, I know thou muſt be laid in the grave with Jeſus Chriſt; he reckons himſelf dead to ſin. That is another thing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, from all theſe expreſſions here in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. we gather this, That ſurely all thoſe that are under grace, or that <hi>walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit,</hi> in ſome eminent way are more holy, and more freed from ſin then once they were, and then all thoſe are that walk under the law, in ſome eminent way I ſay they are more holy, though I do not ſay there is no ſin in them, for then we ſhould <hi>lie,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a power in their ſouls againſt ſin, that is exceedingly tranſcendent in reſpect of the beſt moral men, in reſpect of the exacteſt men in the world, that walk according to the law: what elſe is the meaning of all this? <hi>Ye are dead to ſin,</hi> and <hi>Sin ſhall not reign and have dominion over you,</hi> and you ſhall <hi>not yield your members as inſtruments to ſin?</hi> Shall we turn all this into ſpeculation?
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:184889:46"/> No certainly, there is ſome eminent reall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power againſt ſin that they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; therefore ſaith he, <hi>What pleaſure had you in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> thoſe ſins that you committed before, you are now aſhamed of them.</p>
            <p>And let me look a little upon my own ſoul, or appeal to you; Take any man or woman that underſtands what it is to be under the law, what it is to walk according to the Covenant of works and according to the fleſh, and what covenants, and reſolutions, and promiſes, and faſtings he had, and let him look upon himſelf, what he is now ſince he hath known a little of Chriſt, and hath known that he is a juſtified perſon, and that he is dead to the law, and the like; I appeal to you, whether you do not feel a ſtrange power in your ſouls, killing and ſubduing ſin, that you never imagined before, or almoſt hoped to have. There are ſome Saints that I know, that when they came to know a little of Jeſus Chriſt, they have found a power to ſubdue their ſins, that they did not hope for in their other condition, they were ſo ſtrong; it is an eminent power. A poor Saint that ſees another tugging, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and wraſtling, and buſtling with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, he knows that there is a ſweet power in his ſoul that pulls down the higheſt and proudeſt imaginations. As a godly man ſaith, There is as much difference between a man tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:184889:47"/> walks after the fleſh, according to the law, and he that walks according to the Spirit, as between a man that is in a great Lyter, or in a great Boat, that is faſt upon the Sand, and there are it may be a dozen or twenty men tugging and ſtriving to get it off, and yet it ſticks: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that is in a Boat upon the water, and needs onely to hoiſt ſail, and ſit down and it is gone, he goes with wind and tide. So a man that walks according to grace, he can go as a childe, and ſpeak loving and plain words to his Father, and get power over his ſins, that all the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and roaring, and crying of another a whole year together cannot do. It is ſo, and all you that know what grace is, know it. That is one thing: therefore conſider this, if thou walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, thou art <hi>dead to ſin;</hi> that is, in reſpect of the condemnation and guilt of it, thou heareſt that Chriſt hath fulfilled the law, and that ſin is done away.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, in reſpect of the power of it; thou canſt look upon it as a dying, gaſping thing that muſt die, and thou canſt tread on it through the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou findeſt no luſt ſo ſtrong in thy ſoul, but thou canſt ordinarily bring it down; thou canſt bring it to the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt: another man may throw his cap at his ſins, and be wiſhing and woulding all the year long, but there are ſtrong luſts in his ſoul
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:184889:47"/> that will not out. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, when you walked according to the law, <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin brought forth fruit unto death:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably it will be ſo.</p>
            <p>Then further you ſhall find the fruits of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Spirit: I will but name them to you, and wiſh you to conſider of them. You have many ſet down in this 8th to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a man walks <hi>according to the Spirit,</hi> you ſhall ſee this is one fruit of it. <hi>A Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: for ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.</hi> That is one fruit of it, as ſoon as a man comes to walk <hi>according to the Spirit,</hi> he hath not a ſpirit of bondage any more: What is that? It is nothing but this, a temper of ſoul like a ſlave, juſt as you may conceive of a man that is taken Priſoner in <hi>Turkie,</hi> what temper he is of, he is glad of a Cruſt of bread, and he fears whipping and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and (it may be) killing; ſuch is the temper of a mans ſoul in a ſpirit of bondage: when one is in ſuch a temper that he is alwayes in fear of being whipped and ſcourged, and he hath hard thoughts of God, and he fears that he ſhall prove an hypocrite, and the like. Now ſaith the Apoſtle we have not that ſpirit, but we have <hi>the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:184889:48"/> that is, there is a ſweet temper, ſuch as is in a loving childe to his dear Father, there is a boldneſs, a love, and delight, and rejoycing, and a ſweetneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is one fruit of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as far as thou art under horrour, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and howling, and crying, thou comeſt ſhort of walking according to the Spirit; for thy ſoul would be alway full of ſweetneſs, in the greateſt affliction, if there were a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and under the worſt ſins thou doeſt commit, though there would be ſorrow, yet thou wouldeſt be full of ſweetneſs and joy. That is one thing.</p>
            <p>Again, another fruit and conſequent of it, is that the <hi>Spirit of God bears witneſs with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we are the children of God.</hi> If thou wilt be led by the Spirit, and walk after the Spirit, the Spirit of God will <hi>witneſs with thy ſpirit</hi> that thou art the childe of God. What is that? the meaning of it is this (as I underſtand) the Spirit of God will <hi>raiſe up my ſpirit</hi> to be able to ſee and know that I am the childe of God, for the <hi>ſpirit of a man</hi> knows the natural things of a man, and no more; but the <hi>Spirit of God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth with my ſpirit, that I am the childe of God;</hi> that is, he raiſeth up my ſpirit, whereby I may ſee and know that I am the childe of God; that as before by my own ſpirit I was able to know whether I were poor or rich, whether I were ſick or well, whether I were beloved or hated:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:184889:48"/> ſo now my ſpirit is raiſed up by the Spirit of God, I am able to reflect upon my ſelf ſpiritually, and look upon my ſelf as beloved, and choſen, and holy, and called, and juſtified, and this is a ſpiritual way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is another expreſſion of it, and that is, an <hi>earneſt hope,</hi> or <hi>expectation of the glory that is to be revealed.</hi> I finde, and obſerve little of that to be in Profeſſors, and I have oft marvelled at it, and the reaſon is, Becauſe they have not the Spirit of Adoption, and walk not fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, therefore they are not filled with thoſe expectations, and thoſe earneſt deſires, that the Saints were ordinarily in the Primitive times. Saith the Apoſtle in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>The creature groaneth, and deſires to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: and not onely they, but we our ſelves which have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, we groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</hi> The meaning is, there is no man knows what that glory is that is to be revealed, nor no man what it is to look for it, and expect it. The word in the Original is (as one ſaith) as a woman looks for deliverance when her pains are on her: Oh! ſhe would fain be delivered; or as a man in Priſon that looks for his Friend out of a window, he puts out his head and looks, but he cannot get out, though he fain would. Such an <hi>earneſt</hi> hope, and expectation, and deſire there is in the Saints that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:184889:49"/> walk according to the Spirit, to ſee Jeſus Chriſt come, and to enjoy that glory that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
            <p>There are many more expreſſions there, that are the fruits of it; as the ſpirit of <hi>ſupplication,</hi> ver. 26. and there is alſo a <hi>triumphing</hi> over all our ſpiritual enemies, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>What ſhall we ſay</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

               </gap> 
               <hi>God be with us, who can be againſt us? &amp;c,</hi> And then there is an abſolute dependance upon God for all things; <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> And then there is alſo a patient ſuffering of all afflictions: ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> And then there is laſtly, an abſolute eternal union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in reſpect of his love, <hi>I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, nor any thing ſhall ever be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord.</hi> Theſe are the expreſſions of the fruits of the Spirit of God in the Soul, when men walk according to the Spirit, when they walk according to grace. Take a man that walks according to the fleſh, or according to the law, you ſhall finde none of theſe kinde of things in his ſoul. So much concerning that Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. In the next place, as this Doctrine is a <hi>Touchſtone,</hi> whereby you may try and judge of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:184889:49"/> mens perſons; ſo hereby alſo you may try your <hi>ſervices</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> I ſay this is a rule whereby you may come to know what your ſervices are, what worth is in them. For as they onely are Saints, who walk according to the Spirit (let the world judge how they will) and thoſe that walk carnally, according to the fleſh, according to the law, are not Saints: ſo I ſay thoſe actions or ſervices of ours, that proceed from the ſpirit of God, they are only pleaſing to God, and thoſe that proceed from the fleſh, from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> they are not pleaſing to him. Now I ſay, by this we may try our ſervices and actions, as well as our perſons; for there is the ſame reaſon for both, in all my actions, all that I expect from them, is that they be pleaſing to God: that is the end of all that we do; for they cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us that is done already, or if it be not they cannot do it, but all is to be pleaſing to God. Now then the main Rule by which I am to judge of my actions, it is this, not to judge of them according as they are plauſible to men, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they have affection or enlargement in them (as we call it) but we are to judge of our actions chiefly (if not principally) by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that they flow from, if it be the weakeſt and meaneſt action, if it be the leaſt ſigh, or prayer, if it proceed from the <hi>New Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus, it is ſweet and pleaſing to God, it is an acceptable ſacrifice. But if it be the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:184889:50"/> thing in the world, if it proceed from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> not only from <hi>ſinful Adam,</hi> but from <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Adam,</hi> as he is called the <hi>naturall man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. I ſay that that riſeth from natural wiſdome, and invention, and underſtanding, and memory, <hi>&amp;c</hi> it is but fleſh, and <hi>whatſoever is born of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> and as we ſay, <hi>Pepper is Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> that is, it is dear; ſo <hi>fleſh is fleſh,</hi> that is, it is a filthy abominable thing to God: as it is in this Chapter, <hi>They that walk according to the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> So that that is born of the fleſh, that ſervice that ariſeth from the fleſh, that is done from the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God.</p>

                  <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> Cannot the actions that proceed from the principles of natural <hi>Adam</hi> be pleaſing to God?—Every man knows that of <hi>corrupt Adam</hi> cannot; but cannot that of <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Adam?</hi> As a man may pray meerly by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wit, and bravely to pleaſe man, and to pleaſe himſelf, and he may Preach by a natural wit, and do other Exerciſes, and do them finely, cannot they be pleaſing to God?</p>

            <div type="answer">
               <head>Anſw.</head>
               <p>No, this is a certain rule, that there is nothing that comes from fleſh, from a principle of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> whether it be naturally good or evil, there is nothing whether from <hi>pure Adam,</hi> or from <hi>corrupt Adam,</hi> that is pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is this, Becauſe, as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. that when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned againſt God, you know his puniſhment was that he ſhould die: he was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:184889:50"/> not to eat, or touch the forbidden fruit, leſt he ſhould die. Now when <hi>Adam</hi> eat of that fruit, you know the Curſe came upon him: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this you ſhall finde thoſe phraſes in this Epiſtle, <hi>Whoſoever walks according to the fleſh ſhall die;</hi> whoſoever walks as <hi>Old Adam,</hi> is in the ſtate of the old Curſe, <hi>He ſhall die:</hi> and, <hi>O miſerable man, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death.</hi> He calls it a <hi>body of death,</hi> alluding to the main Curſe of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> which was that he ſhould die.</p>
               <p>Now when the Lord ſaid that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould die for ſin, conceive not that the meaning is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ſhould die perſonally, that his perſon now ſhould be ſubject to the wrath of God, to damnation of ſoul and body for ever in Hell; that is not the onely meaning of it: it is true, he fell under that, but the meaning is this alſo, that whole <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> as thou art a publick perſon thou ſhalt die; that whereas I made and appointed thee to be the Spring and Foundation of all Mankinde, and every man in the world is to have thy Image on him, and I have filled thee with righteouſneſs, and wiſdome, and good things, that may tend much to thy happineſs; and thy poſterity, that thou mayeſt derive a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to them to be like thee in good, and to be pleaſing to me. But when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, now ſaith God, thou ſhalt die, I made thee a happy Creature, and put abundance of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:184889:51"/> in thee for thy ſelf, and thy poſterity, as a publick perſon; but now thou haſt ſinned, and extinguiſhed all that good: Now I will blaſt them all, thy wiſdome, and thy righteouſneſs, thy ſoul, and thy body, thy very being, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall die. Thy perſon as thou art a private man, and as thou art a publick man, ſoul and body, fleſh and bone, all that is in thee, and all that comes from thee, ſhall die. This is that great Curſe that God laid on him, a Curſe of a great extent.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſay, whatſoever now ariſeth from the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſprings from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> be it good or evil, it is condemned to die, it muſt die, it cannot pleaſe God. As <hi>Adam</hi> when he had eaten the forbidden fruit, the Lord ſet an Angel with a Sword to keep the Garden, that he ſhould come in no more. Juſt ſo now ſince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall, the Lord hath ſet a Sword as it were to keep men from all the Principles of <hi>Adam,</hi> that thoſe things ſhall never pleaſe God any more. Or I may ſay of it as <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Jericho,</hi> when he had pulled down and deſtroyed it, <hi>Curſed be the man that buildeth this City any more.</hi> So when God pulled down <hi>Adam</hi> for ſin, the Lord laid that Curſe upon him, that he ſhould never be a bleſſing that way any more, God would never look on him, or any thing that ſhould come from him any more; God would bethink himſelf of <hi>another way,</hi> but that way
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:184889:51"/> he would not meddle with. But now this is our fault, we are ſtill going to build <hi>Jericho</hi> again; we are every man more apt to righteouſneſs then to ſin, ſuch a righteouſneſs as it is; we are apt to go and build up the ruines of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> when we go about the ſervice of God, and to do any thing for him: Or as the people of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 1. God bids them <hi>Ariſe, and go into Canaan,</hi> and then they would not; but by and by they would go, and then God tells them they ſhould never go: So the time was that we might have gone the way of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> when God made him righteous; if we had continued ſo, it had been well, and the more we had endeavoured to be righteous that way, the more bleſſed we had been. But now we are fallen, and God hath curſed <hi>Adam</hi> to die: now any one that goes that way is curſed, that goes about to repair thoſe old ruines; no, ſaith God, do not now anger me in ſeeking to be holy in that way as <hi>Old Adam</hi> was: We muſt labour now to go a new way, and get the <hi>New Adam</hi> Jeſus Chriſt into our ſouls.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why (as it is clear in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) men muſt die, why godly men muſt die as well as the wicked, <hi>It is appointed to all men to die.</hi> Why ſo? The reaſon is this, Becauſe God in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe condemned <hi>old Adam</hi> wholly to die; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdome of God,</hi> no piece of <hi>old Adam:</hi> therefore he being
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:184889:52"/> a publick perſon, and we in him, that Curſe muſt be fulfilled, and we muſt die. All that belongs to <hi>old Adam</hi> muſt die one time or other, <hi>Nolens volens.</hi> Therefore as we bear the Image of <hi>old Adam,</hi> though we have ſome beginnings of <hi>new Adam,</hi> yet becauſe we have the diſpoſition of <hi>old Adam</hi> (I ſpeak not of ſin, but) of <hi>natural Adam,</hi> we are earthly as <hi>Adam</hi> was; therefore we muſt lay down this fleſh and body, becauſe of that great Curſe in Paradiſe, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould die, and all that are of him.</p>

                  <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> Why then doth not corruption (that is a part of <hi>old Adam)</hi> die in the wicked in Hell? You ſay whole <hi>Adam,</hi> corrupt <hi>Adam,</hi> and natural <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die? Now the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in Hell, they have ſin and corruption world without end; for <hi>Cain</hi> is a Murtherer, and <hi>Judas</hi> is a Traytor to this time.</p>

               <p>It is true, that corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> in the Saints muſt die; but that comes not by the curſe, but it is by Chriſt, and is a bleſſing; and that corrupt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſinful <hi>Adam,</hi> lives for ever in them in Hell, it is a part of the Curſe; for, to live in ſin, is to die properly. Now in that we ſhall have this fleſh and blood diſſolved, and ſhall have natural wiſdome and the like all daſhed out, therein we are common with them, that is of the Curſe, though God after (by an after-game, as we may ſpeak with reverence) turned it to a bleſſing. But for the dying of corruption in us,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:184889:52"/> that is the bleſſing of Jeſus Chriſt, and no curſe. It is a curſe, to live in ſin; therefore though <hi>Adam</hi> be wholly to dye, yet the wicked continue in ſin, World without end, even in <hi>Hell.</hi> I mean there are the ſins of the <hi>heart</hi> at the leaſt. And in thoſe places of the New Teſtament I conceive the holy Ghoſt alludes to this, as that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>They that walk after the fleſh ſhall dye:</hi> Why doth he not ſay the plague of God ſhall come on them, but they ſhall dye? It is as if he had ſaid, doe you not remember that God threatened a curſe in Paradiſe to <hi>fleſh,</hi> and he that walks after that ſhall dye; for God hath ſaid, <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall dye. And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> that is, from this <hi>body</hi> that God hath <hi>condemned</hi> to dye. Therefore I ſay whatſoever ſpirngs in us, and comes from us, from old <hi>Adam,</hi> it is a dead thing, that God curſed even in paradice, and therfore cannot be acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>Take the beſt piece of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and offer it to God, and it is as that ſtrange fire that <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> offered, it cannot pleaſe God. Let me give you one chief inſtance that makes my heart bleed when I think of it. That thing that you call <hi>Divinity,</hi> or thoſe that you call <hi>Divines,</hi> they are good words of themſelves; for <hi>John</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Divine:</hi> but that which you call <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is the great Idol of the World, it is nothing but old <hi>Adam,</hi> a kind of <hi>godlineſs</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:184889:53"/> in a naturall way, a man learned after the old <hi>Adam</hi> as we learn Logick, or other things in the Univerſities; and ſuch a one comes and ſcatters this among people, and this you call Divinity, and he is a Divine, and yet this is abominable to God. And that is the reaſon why there are many Divines that preach excellently, and yet God curſeth it, Why? It is old <hi>Adams</hi> wiſedome, and invention, and brave parts, but God curſeth the ſoule; he curſeth that Fig tree that it ſhall bring forth no more.</p>
               <p>O Beloved that we would not ſuffer our ſelves as Children (I had almoſt ſaid as fooles) to be carried on <hi>wheeling</hi> in a Profeſſion of Religion, and to think it enough to carry it plauſibly in duties, in obſerving Faſt-dayes, and dayes of Humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that thou and I may be content to let all the Profeſſors in the Town to go before us that way, let them be more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Profeſſors in outward performances in all they do: let it be thy care and mine to glean the Spirit of God after them; let people ſay there is ſuch a man made ſuch a brave piece of work, and ſuch a man prayed excellent well, and prayed ſo long; let us paſs by theſe things, and if I can do a little from the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; and if God will frame my heart from the Lord Chriſt, and his Spirit, to ſpeak a few words to my Father, this is all I care for. And ſo for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:184889:53"/>
               <p> Therefore I beſeech you, let this ſink into you. That makes you proud, that you cannot rule your hearts, but you are lifted up with pride, when you have done duties, it is becauſe every fine thing you do from old <hi>Adam</hi> makes you proud, you take all in the bulk, and conſider not whence you do things, you conſider not how much of the old <hi>Adam</hi> or of the new there is in your Prayers and duties. Therefore, let this be an univerſal, eternal rule, to know the worth of all your ſervices and actions by, whatſoever is of the fleſh is fleſh, and whatſoever of my Preaching, and of your praying, and lending, and giving, and of your publick actions, if it be not from a Spiritual Principle, from Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel planted in you, it is of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and it is condemned: labour to leave that.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. I ſhall conclude with one word more, and that is this, That this being ſo, that this is to walk according to the Spirit; Then we ſhould long very much for the fulfilling of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Promiſes that God hath made unto us concerning the <hi>latter</hi> times. There is no Saint almoſt now, that I know, but expects glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious times, onely one Saint thinks that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Saints ſhall be in this thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that thing, but every Saint expects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the fulfilling of thoſe Propheſies and Promiſes ſet down in the latter end of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:184889:54"/> and they are glorious ones, whatſoever the meaning of them is, and I think the chief thing there promiſed which ſhall be the height of our happineſs, that the <hi>New Jeruſalem ſhall come down from heaven,</hi> miſtake me not, though it be a conſequent, yet it is not chiefly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch a way of <hi>Government,</hi> this, or that, or the other way, though it be true that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will follow upon it, yet if the meaning of it were onely to Reform our Churches, (though that were a bleſſing) or that Chriſt ſhould come, and reign here <hi>temporally,</hi> and give us Inheritances, and Riches, and the like, truly a Saint would not long much for theſe things. But <hi>the New Jeruſalem ſhall come down from heaven,</hi> and abundance of bleſſings that ſhall go along with it. What is that? The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is, we ſhall have the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel clearly revealed unto us, and we ſhall have Goſpel-principles fully put into our ſouls, which by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> by <hi>Babylon,</hi> we have been ſednced of theſe thirteen or fourteen hundred years. For that was the miſchief of Antichriſt, he hath kept us all his reign under the Old Teſtament with Altars, and Sacrifices, and Prieſts, and I know not what: every thing juſt as they uſed under <hi>Moſes,</hi> and we are not wholly gone out of Antichriſt yet. But the Lord will ſend a light into our hearts, to know the truth in the power and to ſquare our hearts to it. For that is <hi>New</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:184889:54"/> 
                  <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if you compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. where the holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is clearly oppoſite to <hi>Mount Sinai:</hi> So compare it with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. he tells us that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above is the mother of us all; that is, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and the principles thereof in the ſouls of men. Therefore I wiſh that the Lord would ſet your hearts and mine longing after that, that we may have more of the ſpirit of the Goſpel, and of the Principles of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in us; and then for matter of Government of Churches, thoſe things would follow. For to ſet up Government and Diſcipline before this comes into the ſoule, truely it is to build Caſtles in the ayre; for let a man take us, and frame us in the Independent, or Presbyterian way, in what way he will, unleſſe the Principles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel be ſpiritually planted, it will be a fleſhly Independent, and a fleſhly Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian ſervice. Therefore labour chiefly for that, and pray the Lord to fulfil that, and then your Government whatſoever it ſhall be God will reveale it more fully. People are now generally going to build and order Churches, and I know not what, unleſſe the ſpirit (of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) govern in the New Teſtament, it is a vain thing; for if we have our former fleſhly hearts, that walke according to the law, and according to the fleſh, all the Government in the World will never doe us good, becauſe God hath curſed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:184889:55"/> fleſh, and it will never be regulated, and brought to good.</p>
               <p>And this alſo ſhould move us exceedingly to long for the comming of Jeſus Chriſt to glory, for his comming to us, or our comming to him, and the reaſon of that you ſhall have in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49. a glorious word that hath dwelt much in my thoughts. I told you the reaſon why every man muſt dye a naturall death, becauſe of that abſolute grand curſe that <hi>Adam</hi> did fall in as a publick perſon, and we being from him we muſt dye. Now here is the comfort of it; a bleſſed word it is, <hi>As we have born the image of the earthly, ſo we ſhall bear alſo the image of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that is, when the redemption of our bodies comes, at the day of Chriſt, then as we have <hi>borne the Image of the earthly, ſo we ſhall bear the Image of the heavenly.</hi> We have born hitherto, and do beare the Image of naturall <hi>Adam,</hi> we are all his Sons and his Daughters, juſt like him in our wiſdom and underſtandings, and bodies, and ſoules, poore earthly creatures, naturall, frail creatures we are, and by that curſe that was layd upon him we muſt all dye, and lay downe theſe earthly Tabernacles, theſe earthly creatures muſt be diſſolved: <hi>As we have born the Image of the earthly,</hi> not only as we have born the Image of old <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin and wickedneſſe, and pride, and frowardneſſe; ſo now we ſhall bear
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:184889:55"/> the Image of the new, not only in reſpect of grace, and holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, that if I be in him all thoſe corruptions of nature ſhall out, and I ſhall have a new nature. That is true, but that is not all; but as I wholly beare the Image and ſhape of old <hi>Adam,</hi> his body, and ſoule, and ſenſes, and all thoſe muſt dye; ſo when theſe bodies ſhall be raiſed, we ſhall as abſolutely, and largely beare the Image of the new <hi>Adam</hi> the Lord Jeſus in our body &amp; ſenſes, and all our whole man, ſoule and body, in reſpect of ſubſtance as well as quality; we ſhall bear the Image of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> as lively and in as large an extent as ever wee bore the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the earthly <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore that is a great comfort; I will tell you why, becauſe it is not onely the ſinfulneſſe of a Chriſtian that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him, but his earthineſſe, ſo many diſtempers, and troubles, that it is a miſery, the ſpirit is willing but the fleſh is weake, there is ſo much weakneſſe, and earthineſſe, and frailty, ſomtimes a mans heart is right for God, yet his head akes, or his <hi>ſtomack</hi> is full of wind, or he is weary, and wants ſleep, there is ſome frailty or other. This is all earthly <hi>Adam;</hi> all this ſhall be gone, and this kind of body and ſoul ſhall be altered and changed to the Image of the bleſſed ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhall put off our earthineſs as well as our ſinfulneſs, and have his bleſſed compleat image.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:184889:56"/>
               <p> Now how glorious that ſhall be, as you never ſaw the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely by hear-ſay, and by reading the word of God, ſo you have not ſeen the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> but you may partly know by the manifeſtation of his glory on earth, you have heard much of his glory, <hi>We ſaw his glory as of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> we ſhall then ſee him, Phil. 3. 19. <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bodies:</hi> He meanes vile, not onely in reſpect of ſinfulneſs, but of duſtineſs, of earthyneſs and weakneſs; <hi>that they may be like his glorious body, according to his mighty working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelfe;</hi> that is, according to his uſuall manner of working he can doe what he will in Heaven and Earth. We cannot conceive what an image we ſhall have upon our bodies and ſouls, but according to <hi>his wiſdome and mighty power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things,</hi> he will do it.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me tell you this, I finde few or none that have thoſe lively expectations in theſe times of that glory that is to be revealed, that the Saints of old had. See how they ſpeak of it; <hi>What manner of love is this, that we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sons of God? but yet it doth not appear what we ſhall be, for we ſhall be like him:</hi> and, <hi>Gird up the loyns of your mindes, be ſober and watch for the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> The Saints
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:184889:56"/> heretofore, more then half their hearts were in Heaven beforehand: that is the meaning of that, <hi>Our converſation is in heaven.</hi> Juſt as you ſee men that go a long journey, or as you ſee people that have been plundered, that are returning to their own homes, their converſation is there half a year before; their hearts and their thoughts are there, and they wiſh they were there, and are thinking what they will do, and what they will be, when they come there. So, <hi>Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in heaven,</hi> the Saints do ſo long after the glory that is to be revealed in the day of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and Redemption of our bodies, that the moſt part of them is there already. Now we do not conſider of this, becauſe the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is not yet come into our hearts; we have not that Goſpel-temper and frame of ſpirit that the Saints had before.</p>
               <p>That which remains, is a little to ſhew you what your duty is that the Lord hath brought up to <hi>walk according to the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And two or three words I have to ſhew you how you ſhould every one endeavour to attain to it, or to attain it more and more. But I ſhall leave that till the Afternoon.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Rom. 8. 4.</bibl>
               <q>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the foundation of all our happineſs, to have the <hi>righteouſneſs of the law fulfilled in us;</hi> for thereby we are exempted from all miſery, freed from all our enemies, and thereby we are made capable to enjoy all happineſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for all the miſery that man ſuffers here and hereafter, is becauſe he hath not a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to fulfil the law. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever man, or woman it is, that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath beſtowed this great priviledge upon, they muſt needs be in a bleſſed condition.</p>
            <p>Now that we may know whether we are of that number, the Apoſtle tells us that they that have this priviledge, they <hi>walk not according to the fleſh but according to the Spirit;</hi> which was the laſt thing I was upon. I told you what was meant by walking after the fleſh, and what by walking after the Spirit, I gave the Reaſons of it, and made two or three Uſes.</p>
            <p>There are two things remain, which I ſhall
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:184889:57"/> endeavour to ſpeak of at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Firſt, you that have received the Spirit of God, and in ſome meaſure do walk according to the Spirit, &amp; not according to the fleſh, that the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in ſome meaſure come into your hearts, I will give you a few Exhortations from the Lord how you ſhould carry your ſelves. That is the firſt thing I ſhall do, and that ſhall be in four or five ſhort words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, that the Lord having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you to this glorious free eſtate, to this free condition, that you would take heed of <hi>turning the grace of God into wantonneſs,</hi> as many do. And by that I mean but two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That you would take heed of <hi>uſing your liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Of uſing your liberty ſo, as to give offence to your Brethren, or indeed to any.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſay firſt, beware of <hi>uſing your liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh:</hi> That you ſhall have <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>For brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you have been called to liberty, only uſe not your liberty for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the fleſh; but by love ſerve one another.</hi> The Apoſtle ſhews them in that Epiſtle the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition and eſtate that they were in through grace; and here in this Verſe there are two things that he tells them, the one is implied (it is worth obſerving) <hi>ye are called to liberty;</hi> that is, there is a freedome, there is a liberty in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:184889:58"/> the Goſpel in divers things, that did ſeem to be ſinful when ye were under the law, or elſe what ſenſe can you make of this, <hi>Ye are called to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, onely uſe not your liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh?</hi> For we finde that the people under the law, either they made the law ſtricter, or looſer then it was. And there is no man in the world that walks according to the law, but he makes many laws to himſelf, that Chriſt hath not made. Now when the Goſpel comes in clearly, all thoſe laws that you made of your own head, vaniſh. <hi>Ye are called to liberty;</hi> that is, you ſee more freedome, you are not bound to every thing that before you were. Before you muſt not <hi>ſmile,</hi> it was a ſin if you ſeemed to laugh, or ſmile, and a hundred ſuch things: Now <hi>you are called to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty but uſe it not as an occaſion for the fleſh;</hi> that is, take not occaſion from your liberty to live more ſinfully; to ſay you are made free, and others are tyed by the law, and therefore you will live more careleſly, and looſely, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: take heed, and beware of that. There were ſome it ſeems, I am ſure there are ſome now, that all the liberty and freedome they hear of from the Goſpel, or by getting off from the law, it is nothing in the world but that they may go on more in ſin, and enjoy their luſts more freely: this is to pervert the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And what the end of theſe people ſhall be, you may ſee in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and in the Epiſtle of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:184889:58"/> 
               <hi>Jude,</hi> they are <hi>appointed to damnation;</hi> and <hi>their damnation ſlumbereth and ſleepeth not;</hi> that is, they are going on amain, they are going faſter towards Hell then any Drunkard or Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger. A Malefactor never goeth ſo faſt to death, as theſe do to deſtruction; when all the knowledge of liberty that they have, is onely to give occaſion to provide more for their luſts then before. Let us conſider and take heed of that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing is, ſeeing you have liberty by walking according to the Spirit <hi>(for where the Spirit is there is freedome,</hi> that is certain) uſe it not for the offence of your Brethren. As ſome there are that when they hear they are free, are ready to ſay, I care not what all the world ſay, I know this is not a ſin, and therefore I will do it. Beloved, that is far from walking worthy according to the Goſpel: <hi>I became all things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) to all men, that I might win ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me;</hi> I am <hi>under the law to them that are under the law, and without law to them that are without law.</hi> I became all things to all men, that I might gain ſome: ſo we muſt <hi>not pleaſe our ſelves, but one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for edification,</hi> Rom. 15. and <hi>condeſcend to men of low ſort,</hi> Rom 12. <hi>Who is weak</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and I am not weak?</hi> If thou ſee a man under the law, fumbling and wallowing upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> without the knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, deſpiſe him not, and ſay, He is a Legalliſt,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:184889:59"/> and what have we to do with him? but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to frame thy heart, and thy language, and carriage ſo ſuitable to him, that thou mayeſt win upon him, and ſo with others. This is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Goſpel, and the true way of the Spirit of God; when a man knows his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet he <hi>becomes all things to all men,</hi> that he may do them good. There is one word, that I think is the word and will of God, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that thou mayeſt take it ſo, and carry it with thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing that I adviſe you to that are Spiritual, that the Lord hath revealed a little of the Goſpel to, it is this, that you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to walk humbly: O walk humbly. Why ſo? I will tell you why, becauſe a man when he is under the law, he ſhall be twenty years ſtriving for a little knowledge or grace, and ſhall hardly get them: but as ſoon as ever a man comes rightly to Chriſt, and to know him, then there is ſuch a flood of grace, and ſuch <hi>abundance of revelations,</hi> (it is the Scriptures word) there is ſuch abundance of manifeſtations of God, and of the Image of God, when they begin to come in, that it is a hard thing then to keep the ſoul down, for Spiritual things when they come in rightly, when the flood-gates are open, they come in as waves one upon the neck of another. For Spiritual Goſpel-truths multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the Soul a thouſand-fold, one leſſon from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:184889:59"/> another, and one Scripture opens another, and then there is no end, and then it is hard to keep the ſoul humble. Therefore in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. when <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt into the third Heavens, becauſe of the <hi>abundance of revelations</hi> that he had ſeen, (for he had ſeen and heard things that he could not utter, and ſpeak to others) he was ready to be proud, to be lifted up, and leſt he ſhould be ſo, God <hi>ſent a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> It implies, it was a hard thing for <hi>Paul</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle when abundance of revelations came into his ſoul, not to be lifted up. And this ſpoils ſome honeſt hearts; I hope they are ſo, and that God will bring them home, that having been kept bare of food, as ſome Souldiers that went to relieve <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> when they came home to the City, they killed themſelves with eating full and good food: ſo when poor ſouls have gone upon the bare Mountains of <hi>Sinai,</hi> and then have come to the Paſtures of righteouſneſs, they go ſo greedily, and are ſo taken, that if God be not wonderful merciful, they will be undone by being lifted up. Therefore beware of this, learn from <hi>Paul</hi>'s example to ſeek to the Lord to keep your hearts humble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing is this, Endeavour to walk ſimply, I mean, to keep to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel. The Goſpel, though there be glorious Myſteries in it to feed the ſoul, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a plain, ſimple thing. Now here the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:184889:60"/> endeavours to undo ſouls; as it is ordinary in this City, when men come once to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a little of the Goſpel, and to taſte the ſweetneſs of it, the Devil ſcrews them up to ſublimare all Religion into Notions, to cleave a hair, and Religion will be all in <hi>Idea</hi>'s, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the Nature of God, and of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whereas the Goſpel is a plain thing. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to know the <hi>death of Chriſt, and the power of his reſurrection:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth Servants how to obey their Maſters, and Maſters how to carry themſelves to their Servants, and Wives to their Husbands, and ſuch ſimple plain things. Now theſe are accounted nothing: and that is the reaſon that many among us, they do more and more loſe the Word of God, unleſs it be about ſome ſublime Notions. If a Miniſter be upon ſuch Points, ſome high <hi>Idea</hi>'s (for they feed upon ſuch) that is worth the while; but if a Miniſter ſpeak of things that concern their Calling, or their Sex and Condition, that is plain, it hath no taſte in it, no more then the white of an Egge. It is a hard thing to keep to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel. As the Devil tempted our firſt Parents, God gave <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſufficient knowledge to do his will, and they had ſufficient Natural knowledge, for they named all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet notwithſtanding ſhe muſt needs go from the ſimplicity of Gods will, and be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſhe muſt know <hi>good and evil,</hi> there was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:184889:60"/> the diſtinction, <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> thought ſhe, what kinde of good and evil: ſhe goes to this ſublime conceit, and ſo was loſt. Now ſaith <hi>Paul, I am afraid of you, leſt the Devil ſhould beguile you</hi> ſo.</p>
            <p>I am loth to offend you, for I had rather win you, or elſe I could inſtance in twenty or forty conceits and diſtinctions of things, <hi>Idea</hi>'s, that are above the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and that is enough to make us leave them, becauſe they are above the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and the excellency of the Goſpel is not in thoſe <hi>Idea</hi>'s, but in knowing the power of plain things, as the death of Jeſus Chriſt. Every man in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> knew the death of Chriſt; but to know the power of that death, keep cloſe to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another thing is this, you that have known a little of the Spirit of God, and have inlarged hearts, and enlightned eyes, Let not God reſt till thou find the comfort, and power of what thou knoweſt: O we know, that the righteouſneſs of the law by Chriſt is fulfilled in us, and the like: but we have not the full comfort of ſuch a truth, and many others. We know Chriſt hath paid our debt, and that we are one with him, as he is one with the Father; but we have not the power, and the comfort of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Beloved, for thy comfort, know that <hi>Paul</hi> in a ſort was in thy condition. Phil. 3. <hi>Not as though</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:184889:61"/> 
               <hi>I had attained or apprehended,</hi> but I would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him of whom I am apprehended, and I would know the vertue of his death, and the power of his Reſurrection. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw ſomething that he did not fully apprehend, but he would feele more of the power of the Goſpel, ſpirituall truths, and if he ſaw that he wanted, much more we.</p>
            <p>Oh, do not content your ſelves to have an old, frozen knowledge of Goſpell truthes, whereby you are able to prove that men are legalliſts, and that men are under <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi> and yet have cold, and frozen hearts, cold truths without life: therefore thinke of minding God of this.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then laſtly, labour to take heed that you be not by any means bewitched ſo as to fall back from that little light in the Goſpell that you have received, it is an eaſie thing ſo to doe. I doe believe, (and it is my comfort, and will be when I am farr from this place) that the Lord hath enlightened divers of you to know the Goſpel, to know Jeſus Chriſt a little clearer. Now I know not what the Lord may doe for you: but I ſay it is wonderous eaſie, you may under one quarter of a years fleſhly preaching, loſe that that you have been under two or three yeares Preaching a getting. I have knowne, after a quarter of a years building up of my ſoule in the knowledg of Chriſt, and the ſetling
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:184889:61"/> of my faith, and aſſurance, I have heard one Sermon that hath routed and daſht all that work in my ſoule.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you beware, faith is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thing; eſpecially the light we have, that is but very weak, and very tender, therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Who hath bewitched you, you fooliſh Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, before whom Jeſus Chriſt hath been lively painted?</hi> as the word ſignifies; Chriſt was drawn lively before the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and yet they did fall. If <hi>Paul</hi> that was an Apoſtle, and had the ſpirit of God in ſuch a meaſure, laying open the ſpirit of Chriſt, and yet his people did go back to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Lord help and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us. Therefore <hi>ſtand faſt in your liberty in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is all in ſhort I have to ſay to you for that. I hope you will lay up theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. Now I have a few words of <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> to thoſe poor ſouls that do yet in a great meaſure <hi>walk according to the fleſh,</hi> in one faſhion or other. Their Religion is a fleſhly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from <hi>Old Adam,</hi> and according to the law, in a great meaſure. Now the Queſtion is, <hi>What ſhall they do that they may be ſpiritual Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they may walk according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will onely name a few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, I would deſire you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtudy much the difference between
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:184889:62"/> the <hi>two Teſtaments,</hi> the New and the Old: I mean not the <hi>two Books,</hi> but the <hi>two Teſtaments</hi> that we reade of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. whereof the one is faulty, and the other is excellent; the one is done away, the other remains. Study the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them, for thereby you ſay the foundation of your Goſpel-happineſs: for there is the miſery of many Profeſſors, and will be their miſery if they ſhould live a thouſand years, they jumble both Teſtaments, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſtinction, and ſo they will never be better.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing that I would exhort you to, is this, to prize the Spirit of Chriſt more then you do. There is nothing in the Goſpel but it is a Myſterie, you cannot know it but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and there is no duty in the Goſpel to be done, that can be done but by the power of the Spirit. We may do many things in the law by the ſtrength of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> in the Goſpel we can do nothing but the Spirit is all.</p>
            <p>And that is the reaſon I think (for I ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace given me) why people now are left ſo bare, and poor, and confuſed, and know not which way to go, or what to do, they do not prize the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Many men extoll Learning mightily, and it is accounted almoſt Hereſie to commend the Spirit of God. There are many men, I, and many Profeſſors, that do not love to hear a man in a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:184889:62"/> few modeſt words to commend the Spirit of God; but all muſt be by ſtudy, and reading, and learning, and for the Spirit of God it is a plain meer Cypher, and there is an end. But my life on it (if I had a hundred I would ſay ſo) they ſhall be beholden to the Spirit of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll him before they be taught ſpiritually; they ſhall be willing to lay down all their Learning (as I have ſeen a learned godly man of late) even with the Plow-boy.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, but that Learning is good for ſome uſes, and God may bleſs it to help a man to expreſs what he knows the better: but as I told you, <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die, he cannot by it come to know one jot of the ſpiritual meaning of God in the Goſpel, or one jot of power or aſſurance to be happy, or to do any thing for God; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this, all Learning is not worth a ſtraw: therefore labour to extol the Spirit. And if any of you have a minde to learning, go on, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you not from it; Learning is a thing in another element: take pains and diligence to be learned; it is good to do ſo. But if thou wilt be a Goſpel Chriſtian, thou muſt thank the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God for all. Saith <hi>Paul</hi> for all his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I am not ſufficient to ſpeak a good word,</hi> and he was a learned man, that <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Much learning had made him mad. Beza</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Are they Hebrews? ſo am I? Are they Jews? ſo</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:184889:63"/> 
               <hi>am I.</hi> Saith he, I never read in any Latine on Greek Author, ſo much eloquence and elegancy of ſpeech, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath there; and yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he could not <hi>think a good thought</hi> (for all he was learned ſo much) much leſs do a good work.</p>
            <p>As long as thou keepeſt the Spirit an <hi>underling,</hi> as a cypher, as many of the Clergie and learned men, they extol Learning to the Heavens, and many of them upon purpoſe to deſpight the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; as long as they do ſo, they ſhall never know the will of God: <hi>We are not debtors to the fleſh,</hi> but we muſt be <hi>debtors to the Spirit,</hi> if we will have one true thought of Jeſus Chriſt. O praiſe the Spirit, and prize the Spirit! If you have any thought of Chriſt, thank the Spirit; if you have any glimpſe of him in your ſouls worth any thing, praiſe the Spirit.</p>
            <p>That is the reaſon that the Saints in the Book of God, ſpeak not of the Spirit of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſpecial Epithite of Commendation; <hi>Guide me by thy HOLY Spirit;</hi> and ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>thy BLESSED Spirit;</hi> and <hi>thy GRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Spirit;</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of GRACE,</hi> faith another: They never ſpeak of it without ſome word that ſhewed their love to it, and high eſteem of it. When the Lord ſhall come, and his Spirit ſhall be advanced in the hearts of men, we ſhall have glorious times, and never before that, and thoſe times will come. I remember

               <hi>Calvin</hi> on thoſe Propheſies in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Joel, The S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N ſhall be darkened, and the MOON ſhall be turned into blood in that day;</hi> Saith he, the meaning is, all the <hi>excellency</hi> that a man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hath, his Learning and Endowments, in the dayes of the Goſpel, when the Spirit ſhall come with his light, when God ſhall exalt the Spirit, <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood:</hi> Men ſhall not ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem Learning from Books, but learned and great men, and Scholars ſhall come to one <hi>Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and one <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> with ſimple people, all waiting on God by his Word through the Spirit. A man can take his Boy from School that hath his Latine and Greek, and ſend him to the Univerſity, and he aſſures himſelf that he ſhall be as good a Miniſter as his other Son, that (it may be) hath ſerved the Spirit ſeven years: this is our way, and a hundred more, whereby we baſely ſlight, and diſdain the Spirit of God, and do not <hi>honour him,</hi> and therefore he <hi>will not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If ever you will be true Goſpel-Saints, you muſt ſuffer your ſelves to be <hi>led by the Spirit of God.</hi> That phraſe you finde oft in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>If you live in the Spirit, Walk in the Spirit, Be led by the Spirit.</hi> We are not complementary, to commend the Spirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but give it ſcope to lead us. You muſt heed more what the Spirit of God ſaith to you, and what he works
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:184889:64"/> on you. If there come a place of Scripture in your minde, hear and conſider whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath not put it in thy minde, and would have thee ſtudy it, and would have thee compare Scriptures. And when thou comeſt to do any action whatſoever, not ſo much to adviſe with this man, or that man, but what ſaith the Spirit (I mean according to the light of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) hearken to that more then what all the world ſaith. Therefore I have known ſome men that in their whole lives have often m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt the will of God in circumſtantial things uſually, it may be for a year, or two, or three, and they have miſt it again in another thing, and in another thing: and when they have examined how this comes about, they can ſay, If they had hearkned to the Spirit, they had not done ſo, but they hearkned to men, and ſo went againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Spirit in their Conſcience, they would hear what this man ſaid, and what the other man did: But now the Spirit will ſay to them, You ſee I would have ſhewed you the right way, but you would not give me ſcope, but made a cypher of me. And for my one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I do not yet ſee how I ſhould ever have miſt the will of God ſince I knew him, if I had heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Spirit of God, if I had but obſerved ſo much light as the Spirit had put into my heart. Now we ballance the Spirit with this mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and with the other mans opinion, and ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:184889:64"/> come home by <hi>Weeping Croſs.</hi> Therefore give ſcope to the Spirit, I mean not againſt the Word, or above the Word, but ſtill I mean the Spirit of God working according to the Scriptures, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another thing, and a ſpecial one is, I wiſh you for the Myſteries of the Goſpel to ſtudy the Scriptures in the ſimplicity of them, without the gloſſes of men: for a man in extremity muſt do that that a man that is not in extremity would not do. We have brought our ſelves in ſuch ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to men, that we muſt take that courſe that another ſober man ſhould not; I mean thus, when ever we go to look for any truth of God, for the will of God, we have notions in our mindes beforehand, according to the times and places we live in. As concerning Baptiſm, what need I go to the Scriptures? ſaith one, we have it in ſuch and ſuch mens Writings? and ſo we foreſtall the will of God, that we are blinded, and cannot ſee it.</p>
            <p>Therefore if you will ſee the will of God, I wiſh you (for a while) to look on the naked Scriptures. And for my part I know but three uſes to be made of other Books.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As firſt there is this uſe of Books, you have Books that will read the Scriptures in divers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and ſhew the Originall, and open the tongues; now when I ſee a word in Engliſh, and doubt of the meaning of it, then I will go to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:184889:65"/> Greek or Hebrew, as God hath endowed me with knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then there is another uſe of Books, when I reade one ſingle Scripture, it may be I have a Book that will point out halfe a dozen Scriptures to open one Scripture by.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it may be I have ſome Books that take ſome Scripture, and preſſe it upon my ſoule, as Doctor <hi>Preſtons,</hi> and other godly Books. But to take Books, and ſay, <hi>Jerome</hi> thinks this, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> that, and fill our heads with notions, they blind us that we cannot ſee the will of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore in reading of the Scriptures there ſhould be this difference, from our reading of other Books, I mean in reſpect of age. When we are Children, and young, we uſe not Spect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles; it may be at twenty, or thirty, or fourty yeares old, we can reade without Spectacles; but when we come tofifty, or ſixty, then we can ſee nothing but through Spectacles. It ſhould be juſt contrary with us, when we are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> When we are young we uſually never read the word of God but through the Spect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles of mens gloſſes; but when we are older Chriſtians and ſtronger Saints, we ſhould learne to read better without Spectacles; we ſhould daily make leſſe uſe of Mens Books, and more of Gods Book. That whereas before a man tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over twenty Authors upon a point: Now he can go humbly to God with his Bible, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:184889:65"/> without Spectacles he can ſee what the will of God is. Therefore lay aſide Spectacles ſometimes and only take the ſpirit of God, and compare Scripture with Scripture, that you may come to know the mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Shall I name one thing more? If you would come to be ſpirituall, Goſpel-Saints, you muſt be born again; you muſt be born from above. A <hi>Goſpell profeſsion</hi> is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from above, and there are none that can come into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is from above, but thoſe that are borne from above. Therefore marke our Saviours reaſoning <hi>Jehn</hi> 3. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> asks Chriſt which was the way to Heaven? And he tells him, <hi>Verily thou muſt be born again,</hi> or thou muſt be <hi>born from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> or elſe thou canſt not ſee it; <hi>Nicodemus</hi> wonders why he muſt be <hi>born from above,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Shall I go into my Mothers belly, &amp;c.</hi> Saith Chriſt, marvell not, wonder not; why ſhould he not wonder at ſuch a ſtrange ſpeech? Here is the reaſon, <hi>That which is born of fleſh is fleſh;</hi> therefore think it not ſtrange that I ſay thou muſt be <hi>born again.</hi> So I ſay, whatſoever you do by the power of nature, by your own wiſedome, by your <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> or your own ſtrength, all comes but to this, but to <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>whatſoever comes of fleſh is fleſh:</hi> fleſh cannot bring out the ſpirit no more then a <hi>thorn</hi> can bring out <hi>grapes,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks. Therefore wonder not that thou muſt be born from above, that is, thou
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:184889:66"/> muſt have the Lord from above to beget thee again. You have every one been born once, you muſt be born once more, you muſt have a new creation in you: the Lord muſt create new, ſtrange properties, and diſpoſitions, that no fleſh, and blood is able to comprehend.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, take the counſell of the Holy Ghoſt, and that is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 16. As Paul prayed for them, ſo do thou pray for thy ſelf, and there is all the reaſon in the world that thou ſhouldeſt; <hi>I ceaſe not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my Prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory would give to you the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation in the knowledge of him. Pray</hi> for the ſpirit of wiſedome and revelation in the knowledge of Chriſt. Slight not theſe words, becauſe ſome wicked men abuſe them, and others reproach them; but becauſe Paul ſaith ſo, pray that the Lord would give the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation. So much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Directions I had to give you.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 6. There is one word of <hi>Information,</hi> and with that I will conclude. From what I have ſaid before concerning the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> learn this Inſtruction more, hence to ſee what is the true ground of all Perſecutions, nay even of all the Diviſions that are among us; men may pretend what they will, and deceive themſelves, but all the ſtrife and perſecution in the world is meerly between the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:184889:66"/> 
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> between the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Adam.</hi> There are two Princes in this World, and theſe are contrary the one to the other; <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit: Old Adam</hi> ſeeks to get up, the <hi>New Adam</hi> will have him down. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall have theſe two in every Town, in one Church, in one Family, in one Soul, and whereſoever they are, <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe two are contrary.</hi> Are contrary, what is that? that is, there is no true contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween any things in the world, but between the <hi>Old Adam</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> between the fleſh and the Spirit. Now by <hi>Fleſh</hi> I mean not onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but whole fleſh, fleſhly wiſdome. The wiſdome of the <hi>Old Adam</hi> is enmity againſt the <hi>New;</hi> the righteouſneſs of <hi>Old Adam</hi> is quite contrary to the righteouſneſs of the <hi>New:</hi> this is the cauſe of perſecution.</p>
            <p>Let people pretend what they will, you ſhall ſee godly men perſecuted, you may ſee Chriſt in their Souls as clearly as the Sun, and people keep a coyle about <hi>Independency</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but the truth is, it is <hi>Old Adam</hi> in thoſe that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and the <hi>New Adam</hi> in the other, a man with one eye may ſee it. There are many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, but all the ſtrife is between the <hi>Old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and the <hi>New.</hi> For (to give a little illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) take Goſpel godly Saints that have the Spirit of God in them, they agree well enough,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:184889:67"/> they will not ſtrive, ſometimes they may differ a little, but for the generality they live well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough together; nay, take ſome Goſpel Saints that are filled with the Spirit of God, and the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt (in theſe times, and in this City which is the Centre of all Diviſion) and they cannot atteſt diviſions, they cannot make a Party, and give railing for railing, and ſtrife for ſtrife; they cannot but <hi>love their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and <hi>bleſs them that blaſpheme them.</hi> As <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whence come all wars?</hi> You think they come from your zeal for <hi>your Way,</hi> and yours for <hi>your Way,</hi> but it is <hi>from your luſts: The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh;</hi> it is from <hi>Old Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I was going to ſay, but I will but name it. This is the cauſe alſo of the weakneſs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that is among you. It is not wickedneſs that troubles a Saint, but weakneſs; it is not poſitive ills, but weakneſs. And whence is this weakneſs? becauſe he <hi>walks after the fleſh:</hi> the Spirit is powerful, but the fleſh is weak. As the Scripture faith, <hi>Their horſes are fleſh and not ſpirit:</hi> ſo I may ſay, Your Prayers are fleſh and not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and it may be my Preaching, and it may be our endeavours to reſiſt ſin. But as far as they are fleſh they are weak enough: but where the Spirit is, there is power; <hi>I can do all things,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> I can <hi>preach the Goſpel from Jeruſalem to Illyricum;</hi> and <hi>I ſhall come to you in the fulneſs</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:184889:67"/> 
               <hi>of Chriſt.</hi> A man would think he had been mad, but it was the ſtrength of his ſpirit. A poor weak Chriſtian he doth nothing but wiſh, and would, and confeſſeth his ſins to day, and falls into it again to morrow, and then confeſſeth again; and, <hi>When will it once be, O Jeruſalem?</hi> but the Goſpel is <hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> and all the principles of it are powerful, and all the precepts of it have a power through the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for a man to keep and obſerve them.</p>
            <p>Men talk that the learning of Chriſt, and the knowledge of the Goſpel is to make men looſe and licentious. It is true, carnal vain hearts, the better any thing is, the worſe they be; but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelves, concerning true Saints it is falſe: for the onely way to be lively, and luſty, and fruitful in good, is to know Chriſt more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel. Let men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſay ſo as long as they will, they ſhall be but poor old barren creatures: you will be wiſhing, but you ſhall never overcome your ſins. I have known ſome Saints, that by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt have had power to ſubdue thoſe ſins, and to bring them under, that before they never ſo much as hoped to bring under in this world; yet the power of Chriſt hath brought them under, when all their Faſtings and Humiliations would never do it, when they were in that way, without the clear knowledge of Chriſt; but when they have come to Chriſt they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:184889:68"/> have found it done. In 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. you ſhall finde there, men that were carnal, men that were as <hi>dogs that returned to their vomit,</hi> yet the <hi>common knowledge</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt did make them clean from <hi>the pollutions of the world,</hi> and did give them power againſt their ſins, what then will the <hi>ſpiritual effectual knowledge</hi> of Chriſt do? Therefore never entertain any prejudice againſt Chriſt, or againſt his Goſpel, or againſt his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and his Wayes, for if there be any power in this world, it is there: all the reſt is but a flouriſh, but a ſhew of mortification, when the heart is as full of luſts, as a Toad is of poyſon, There is no true mortification or holineſs, but what comes from Chriſt and his holy Spirit.</p>

            <p>IN the former Verſe you remember how I ſhewed you that there was a great priviledge to all true Beleevers, which indeed is the chiefe of all Priviledge, for it is the inlet of all mercies, and the principall deliverance from all evills. It
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:184889:68"/> is contained in the beginning of Verſe 4. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> In the latter end of the Verſe I ſhewed the perſon more largely deſcribed, to whom this priviledge doth belong; that is, <hi>Not thoſe that walk after the fleſh,</hi> but thoſe <hi>that walk after the ſpirit.</hi> And I have as God enabled me opened the meaning of that to you, what it was to walk after the Fleſh, and what to walk after the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle in this fifth Verſe goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a little more particularly to diſcover thoſe that have a right to this priviledge, by drawing one thing from another. The main was, <hi>They walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> I, but that is a generall word, and how ſhall we know that? Saith he, you ſhall know that alſo by this, <hi>They that are after the fleſh do mind fleſhly things, and they that are after the ſpirit do minde ſpirituall things:</hi> You ſhall know whether you have the righteouſneſs of the law fulfilled in you, if you <hi>walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.</hi> And you ſhall know that alſo by your minding, by the frame of your mindes; if you walk after the fleſh you will <hi>mind fleſhly things,</hi> if you walk after the ſpirit you will mind ſpirituall things. And then he goes on to prove that alſo; as we ſee oft in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. where one thing is made the mark of another by a gradation; there are five or ſix things, and one thing proves another, <hi>we know that we are the children of God</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:184889:69"/> 
               <hi>if we keep his Commandements;</hi> and we know we keep his Commandements by another thing, and we know that by another thing. So that I ſay the Scope of the Apoſtle is to cleare unto the Saints their right &amp; title to this great priviledge, and alſo withall, to convince thoſe that are carnal that they are without it, and to ſhew them their great miſerie in being ſo; for you ſhall ſee after, how as he diſcovers them, ſo alſo he ſhews their miſery, he ſaith they <hi>are enmity to God,</hi> and <hi>they that walk after the fleſh muſt dye, &amp;c.</hi> Now that we may go on breifly to handle this a little to you; you may take the Doctrine as it lyes here in the words: (for I will not, nor need not frame it otherwiſe)</p>
            <q>Doct. <hi>That thoſe that are after the fleſh, do minde the things of the fleſh.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Only remember what I ſaid before, for it is of great concernment; for that great priviledge depends upon this: if you have the righteouſneſs of the law fulfilled in you, you muſt be thoſe that walk according to the ſpirit, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh: And then would you know that? ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Thoſe that are after the fleſh do minde the things of the fleſh, and thoſe that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit:</hi> ſo let that be the Doctrine or Leſſon.</p>
            <p>I will give you but two ſhort words to prove this to you, and then to open it as God ſhall help us.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The firſt thing to prove it is this, that it muſt be ſo, becauſe every thing in the world, in all the Creation of God, doth act according to the nature of its <hi>principle</hi> from whence it flows. As <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 11, 12. <hi>Doth a fountain ſend forth from the ſame place ſweet water and bitter? Can a figtree (my Brethren) bear olive-berries, or can a Vine bear figs?</hi> You know that a Fig-tree bears Figs, and a Vine-tree bears Grapes, and an Apple-tree bears Apples, and a Pear-tree Pears, and every Tree, and every thing will work according to its principle. <hi>Make the tree good</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and then the fruit will be good;</hi> ſuch as the tree is, ſuch will be the fruit; ſuch as the fountain is, ſuch will be the ſtream: and when a mans principles, the frame of his heart is nothing but fleſh, then of neceſſity his actions muſt be fleſhly, his affections muſt be fleſhly. If he have a fleſhly minde, he muſt have a fleſhly will, a fleſhly love, fleſhly hatred, a fleſhly life, fleſhly prayers, fleſhly Sacraments, fleſhly every thing: for every thing muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its principle. So, on the other ſide, where the principle is ſpiritual, there a man will minde ſpiritual things, he will love ſpiritual things, he will do ſpiritual things, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſpirituall things. That is one Reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. And the ſecond is this (for I will give you but theſe two, becauſe the chief thing that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:184889:70"/> I intend at this time is the opening of it) fleſhly carnal men that are after the fleſh, they muſt minde fleſhly things, becauſe they know not ſpiritual things, they underſtand not ſpiritual things: Or if you will (and it may be that word hath ſomething more in it) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. they <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not ſpiritual things,</hi> they do not <hi>ken</hi> and perceive them. Now you know that a man mindes not (I mean look upon it as the acting of the underſtanding) a man cannot minde, but what he knows; a man cannot think of things he knows not. That is the reaſon to prove that poor ignorant people ſpeak an untruth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, when they ſay, we remember God, we minde God, whereſoever we are, and yet they know not God; for God is not minded but when he is known. As in that place of the <hi>Corinthians, A natural man cannot perceive the things of the ſpirit;</hi> he doth not know Jeſus Chriſt, therefore he cannot minde him; he doth not know the things of the ſpirit of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot ſet his heart upon them; <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge the minde cannot be good;</hi> that is, till a man have a ſtock of knowledge of things, he can never act his underſtanding and minde about it. There are two ſhort Reaſons why thoſe that are carnal and fleſhly, thoſe that are after the fleſh, they minde the things of the fleſh, and they minde nothing elſe, nor cannot; and thoſe that are after the ſpirit, minde the things
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:184889:70"/> of the ſpirit, becauſe they know them, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, and underſtanding them, they cannot chooſe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. but <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves in them day and night:</hi> they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their thoughts and affections, and all in them.</p>
            <p>Now for the opening of it unto you, here are three queſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>What is meant by being after the fleſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, <hi>What is meant by the things of the fleſh, and the things of the Spirit?</hi> I will put them both together, for the one will open the other.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, <hi>What is meant by minding the things of the fleſh, and by minding the things of the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, by <hi>being after the fleſh,</hi> it is in effect the ſame that I told you before, to walk after the fleſh; therefore if you have not forgotten that, you will eaſily underſtand this. But yet to make it clearer, you muſt underſtand, that a man is ſaid to be after the fleſh, or carnal, for ſo they reade it in Latine, <hi>Qui carnalis, &amp;c.</hi> Men are ſaid to be carnal, or after the fleſh three wayes.</p>
            <p>The firſt is when a man is a true Saint, but hath but a little meaſure of grace, and hath much corruption, much fleſh. It pleaſeth the holy Ghoſt many times to denominate ſuch a man by the greateſt part that is in him, which is fleſh, and ſo to call him <hi>Carnal;</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſaith
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:184889:71"/> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking how ſpiritual the law is, but ſaith he, <hi>I am carnal, ſold under ſin;</hi> ſold to ſin: not that there was <hi>no grace</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> but that there was ſuch abundance of corruption, at leaſt in his feeling. So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Are ye not carnal?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> have ye not <hi>need of milk?</hi> are ye not <hi>babes?</hi> When I hear there are ſuch <hi>diviſions,</hi> that ſome are for <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Cephas, Are ye not carnal?</hi> are ye not after the fleſh? that is, Is there not a world of corruption in you? doth not corruption rule and bear ſway, over that little grace that is in you? So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>If any man be overtaken with ſin, you that are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a one;</hi> that is, as if he had ſaid, There are ſome carnal, and they cannot keep themſelves from being <hi>overtaken</hi> frequently with ſin, and much leſs can ſuch <hi>reſtore others;</hi> but a ſpiritual man, one that the ſpirit hath prevailed in ſome meaſure over the fleſh, in keeping him from the foils and falls that weak men fall into, and making him able in ſome meaſure to raiſe and heal others. Now ſo we are not to underſtand it here in this place, when he ſaith, <hi>They that are after the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a man may be ſaid to be after the Fleſh, or to be carnall. A man that is a true Saint may be called carnall, when he doth ſome one action that may in a ſence be wholy carnall. For a Saint may do an action that he, nor none about him may perceive any thing but carnallity
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:184889:71"/> in. As in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. Compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 32. There you ſhall ſee a godly Saint, <hi>Peter</hi> by name, when his Maſter was Preaching to him, what he ſhould ſuffer at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and how he ſhould be put to death, and the like: <hi>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from the Lord; this ſhall not be unto thee.</hi> This was a Fleſhly ſpeech, a meer carnall ſpeech. Chriſt was going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to die for <hi>Peter,</hi> and for other poore ſinners, and <hi>Peter</hi> takes him aſide, and rebukes his Maſter, and tells him it ſhould not be ſo, <hi>Far be it from thee.</hi> Chriſt takes him, ahd tells him, <hi>Get thee behind me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, thou art an offence to mee: for thou ſavoureſt not the things of God, but the things of men.</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt as a carnall fleſhly man, thou haſt no taſt of ſpirituall things. If thou diddeſt looke on it ſpiritually, thou wouldeſt rejoyce, and pray the Lord to help thee to ſuffer in that temptation with thy Maſter, or to make a ſpiritual uſe of it, but thou art carnall, and ſavoureſt of Fleſh. Now when the Apoſtle ſayeth here, <hi>They that are afeer the Fleſh, do mind the things of the Fleſh,</hi> he doth not properly mean that neither.</p>
            <p>But thirdly and laſtly, a man is ſaid to be after the fleſh, when he is in his pure naturals; when he is meerly carnal, when he is wholly fleſh, when he is deſtitute of the ſpirit of God: when men are ſo fleſh and fleſhly in their principles and actions, that there is nothing of the Spirit
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:184889:72"/> of God in them. So it is principally to be taken here. Though for the former two I may ſay this, that as far as a Saint, either in the meaſure of his graces, or in his actions, is fleſhly, he mindes fleſhly things; but a man that is wholly fleſhly, wholly mindes fleſhly things. And ſo much concerning the firſt Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, <hi>What is meant here by the things of the fleſh, and by the things of the ſpirit?</hi> If you remember what I have told you of fleſh before, you will underſtand much what is meant by the things of the fleſh. I told you <hi>Fleſh</hi> was <hi>Old Adam,</hi> both in his good, and in his evil, <hi>pure Adam,</hi> and <hi>corrupt Adam,</hi> and every thing that came from him, or every thing that leads to him, that was <hi>Fleſh.</hi> So the things of the fleſh are theſe things, and all opportunities belonging to them in general.</p>
            <p>But, that you may underſtand it a little better, I will ſhew you what the holy Ghoſt calls theſe <hi>things of the fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>things of the ſpirit,</hi> that ſo by the Scriptures you may underſtand Scriptures. We will put them both together, the one will open the other to you. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. there you ſhall ſee the things of the fleſh are called the things of a man: <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man which is in him.</hi> The <hi>things of a man:</hi> The <hi>things of the fleſh</hi> are the <hi>things of a man,</hi> that is, proper to a man as man. Therefore <hi>Mark</hi> 8.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:184889:72"/> 32. they are called, <hi>The things that be of men.</hi> The things of the fleſh are called the things that men deal about, the things that men as men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deal about, and look after, the things of men. But the things of <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. you have divers expreſſions of them: <hi>ver.</hi> 9. they are the things that <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> What are theſe things? theſe glorious things that no carnal man hath ever ſeen or heard, or underſtood any thing of them, that <hi>God hath prepared for them that love him?</hi> They are, as we ſee there afterwards, clearly the <hi>things of the Spirit of God.</hi> They are called <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> ver. 10. they are deep, becauſe no carnal man can reach them; and in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. they are called <hi>the things of God;</hi> and in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>The things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 14. they are called the <hi>the things of the Spirit of God; The things of the Spirit of God are fooliſhneſs to him.</hi> In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> there you ſhall have both theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: for in that we ſhall have a little light from that deſcription of it; the things of the fleſh are called there the <hi>things that are ſeen,</hi> and the things of the Spirit are called the <hi>things that are not ſeen;</hi> the one are ſaid to be temporal, and the other eternal. The things of the fleſh are temporal things that may be ſeen, that is, not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:184889:73"/> ſo much ſeen with the eyes of the body, but he means that a man, every carnal man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and underſtand them. All the things of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> a meer natural man is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, but the other things are things that are not ſeen; that is, that <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man.</hi> Therefore Chriſt in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. ſaith, <hi>I thank thee, O heavenly Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes.</hi> What were theſe things? the things of the ſpirit of God, they are the things that are hid from the wiſe and prudent of the world, they are not poſſible to be ſeen of them, but God reveals them to the <hi>leaſt babe</hi> of his own kingdome. In <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 1, 2. you have another deſcription: for you may put theſe together, and ſo the better underſtand them. In <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the things of the fleſh are called <hi>things on earth,</hi> and the things of the Spirit are called <hi>the things that are above.</hi> The <hi>things of the fleſh</hi> are the things that are <hi>beneath,</hi> as it were, things on the earth; that is, though in <hi>Old Adam</hi> there be many excellent things, (you muſt not conceive <hi>Earth</hi> here in a groſs ſenſe) there is fine refined wiſdome, and underſtanding, and prudence, which the ſpirit of God uſually ſlights and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth; <hi>Where is the wiſe and the diſputer, &amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding, all <hi>Old Adam</hi> is but earthly; all the ſpirituality, as it were, of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:184889:73"/> but <hi>things on the earth.</hi> It is no wonder they are called things of the Earth, when the Doctrine and Preaching of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> he himſelf calls it Earthly; <hi>I am from the earth,</hi> I ſpeak earthly; He is from <hi>above,</hi> he ſpeaks heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. It was earthly in compariſon of Chriſt, though there was ſome Goſpel in it. Much more earthly is all the devotion and Religion, and what is beſt in fleſhly man, that hath nothing in him but <hi>Old Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7. there is another large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things. The things of the fleſh there, they are thoſe things that <hi>Paul</hi> once accounted gaine to him, and thoſe things that <hi>Paul</hi> now accounted loſſe to him, ſee there what thoſe things are, thoſe excellent fine things, the things of the fleſh; a man while he is in the fleſh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts them gaine, a great gaine to him; he lives by his wit, and his wiſedome, and it is a mighty gaine to him to increaſe, and build up <hi>old Adam</hi> in him. But when a man comes to ſpirituall things, he accounts all theſe things loſs: <hi>I account them loſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> Now the things of the ſpirit, were thoſe things that <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to win, and to gain; in the verſes following, <hi>That I may gain Chriſt and his righteouſneſs;</hi> and a little further, you ſhall ſee <hi>Paul</hi> calls the things of the fleſh the <hi>things behinde,</hi> and the things of the Spirit the <hi>things before.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. the things of the fleſh he calls them earthly things.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:184889:74"/> 
               <hi>They minde earthly things;</hi> and ſo by contraries, the other things are heavenly. I cannot open every particular expreſſion, onely I would point out the deſcriptions to you, as the Holy Ghoſt layes them down. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. there the things of the fleſh are called <hi>old things,</hi> and the things of the Spirit are called <hi>new things:</hi> for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We know no man after the fleſh, yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet know we him ſo no more: therefore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature, old things are paſſed away:</hi> all the things of the Fleſh are old things, the things of the Spirit of God are new things. Therefore in the <hi>Acts,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> deſired to know the <hi>new</hi> ſtrange <hi>doctrine</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> brought.</p>
            <p>What was this <hi>new doctrine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely the things concerning the Spirit of God, the other things are <hi>old things, Gal.</hi> 2. 18. there the things of the fleſh are deſcribed to be the things that <hi>Paul</hi> deſtroyed, and the things of the Spirit the things that <hi>Paul</hi> ſought to build up. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 32, 33. the things of the fleſh are called <hi>the things of the world,</hi> but the things of the Spirit are called there <hi>the things of the Lord; The married cares for the things of the world, but the unmarried for the things of the Lord.</hi> Phil. 2. 23. the things of the fleſh are called <hi>our own things,</hi> and the things of the Spirit are called <hi>the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:184889:74"/> 
               <hi>have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your ſtate:</hi> Mark that expreſſion, it is well worth obſerving in theſe ſelf-ſeeking times. We may well ſay ſo now, if <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid ſo then, <hi>I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your eſtate.</hi> A man can hardly finde a Profeſſor in a multitude, that will naturally and freely care for the ſtate of others of the Saints: for, ſaith he, <hi>All ſeek their own, and not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts:</hi> all ſeek their own things, the things that make for old <hi>Adam,</hi> that make for the Fleſh, and for mans ſelf. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. the things of the Fleſh are called <hi>meat that periſheth,</hi> and the things of the Spirit <hi>meat that endureth to everlaſting life. Luke</hi> 10. 41. they are called <hi>many things,</hi> and the things of the Spirit are called <hi>one thing; Martha, Martha, thou art cumbred about many things:</hi> for indeed there are many diſtracting buſineſſes in the things of the world; therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. when the ſeed was ſown among thorns, it is ſaid, <hi>the deceitfulneſs of riches and pleaſures, and the luſts of other things;</hi> who knows how many, it may be a <hi>thouſand, two thouſand</hi> other things; the things of the Fleſh are endleſs, but the things of the Spirit are called <hi>one thing;</hi> the ruinous building of old <hi>Adam</hi> is going into a thouſand pieces, but there is but one Jeſus Chriſt, and in the things of Jeſus Chriſt there is a greater union then in the things of the Fleſh, and old <hi>Adam.</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> 19. they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:184889:75"/> are called <hi>the things of trouble,</hi> and the things of the Spirit <hi>the things that belong to our peace: O that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace!</hi> In <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 8. they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led things that do <hi>not profit, vain things,</hi> and the things of the Spirit in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 10. they are called <hi>excellent things; That ye may be able to know the things that are excellent,</hi> that is, the things of the Spirit of God. And to conclude this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. ſpeaking of the things of the Spirit, ſaith he, <hi>Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report, theſe things do.</hi> Theſe are the things of the Spirit of God. Then <hi>impure</hi> things, <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> things, <hi>diſhonourable</hi> things, <hi>unjuſt</hi> things, <hi>unlovely</hi> things, theſe are things of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the things of the Fleſh in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>But now in particular, I will ſum up the things of the Fleſh, or of old <hi>Adam</hi> (one or other of which fleſhly men do wholly minde) to theſe three Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is to <hi>eſtabliſh their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> by the law, to procure to themſelves <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by their works.</hi> This is the Maſter-piece of old <hi>Adam:</hi> for I told you, that man is more prone to this then to ſin, though he be prone to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:184889:75"/> that alſo; and old <hi>Adam</hi> works ſtronger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his righteouſneſs (ſuch as it is) in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden way, then to ſin. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>They being ignorant of Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> He ſpeaks there of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The word in the Original is, they went to make it <hi>ſtand;</hi> juſt as a <hi>tottered houſe</hi> that every blaſt is ready to throw down, and it muſt be underpropped on this ſide, and on that ſide to keep it up: ſo every fleſhly man in the world, this is half his work, to make the <hi>Babel</hi> of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſtand; he is alway piecing and patching, and doing ſome good work, he is wiſhing and woulding, or in ſome faſhion or other to make up a good eſtate againſt the latter day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that was the queſtion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and it is the grand queſtion of all mankinde, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> and we ſee when they came to Chriſt, it was alway with this, <hi>Maſter, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know it muſt be by doing, and I am willing to go about it to frame ſome kinde of righteouſneſs or other: Therefore in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. ſay they, <hi>What ſhall we do to work the works of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life?</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>This is the work of God to believe;</hi> he takes them off.</p>
            <p>Now this is one thing whereby you may know what it is to be a fleſhly man, and to <hi>minde fleſhly things,</hi> when people minde, and caſt projects
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:184889:76"/> and wayes to procure righteouſneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or juſtification to their ſouls, any other way, then onely by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Men may be as it were drunk ſometimes, and minde neither Heaven nor Hell; but there is no fleſhly carnal man, when he is his own man, but he thinks there is ſome good work or other that he muſt do, either giving, or lending, or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Alms-houſe, or giving to the poor, or ſomewhat to get him a righteouſneſs: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, thou art a carnal man, and all thy minding, and all thy thoughts this way, are but according to the fleſh, and thoſe that are after the fleſh muſt die. It was the firſt and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Curſe that ever was in the world, when God ſaid to old <hi>Adam,</hi> he muſt die: it is a general rule, all old <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die, either thou muſt get that piece of old <hi>Adam</hi> that is in thee to die, or thou ſhalt die with it, one of the two.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then another thing that is called the things of the Fleſh, it is <hi>Carnal Priviledges,</hi> either men that are fleſhly minde their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of Chriſt, or elſe their Carnal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. I told you before that thoſe are called <hi>Fleſh:</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If any might,</hi> I may <hi>glory in the fleſh.</hi> What is that? <hi>I am an Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. they were apt, as to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſs, ſo to glory in their priviledges, <hi>We are the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:184889:76"/> 
               <hi>we were never ſlaves</hi> or <hi>ſervants.</hi> We have not their priviledges to glory in, yet this is a main piece of old <hi>Adam,</hi> a great part of the <hi>things of the fleſh,</hi> outward priviledges, let them be Church-priviledges, or what you will: when people rejoyce, and minde and contemplate out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, and do not regard the inward power, nor what is in, and through and by them, this is but fleſh.</p>
            <p>I fear you will not <hi>bear with me,</hi> you will <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count me your enemy for telling you the truth:</hi> but I am perſwaded there are many among us that talk of Churches, and Government, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Priviledges, and yet all is but fleſh, and you cannot well judge of them by their ſtrictneſs in it; for fleſh will go as ſtrictly in its way as the Spirit: but it is to be feared, that divers build of it, and glory in it, and it is a great part of their Religion: I warn you in love to look to it, and if thoſe Priviledges were taken away, as Chriſt took away the priviledge of being the <hi>children of Abraham</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch people would be poor carnal people. Take heed of it, and <hi>let him that glories, glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, and laſtly, the things of the fleſh (for all old <hi>Adam</hi> is included in theſe three things) that fleſhly men minde, is to <hi>fulfill their luſts,</hi> which are many; <hi>to make proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 13. that is, to be caſting how to feed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:184889:77"/> one luſt or other. Now if you would know what thoſe luſts are in particular, (though in a ſort it be general) you have it in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. ſaith he, <hi>All that is in the world, is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life.</hi> Theſe are the luſts of the world; all the luſts in the world may be reduced it ſeems to thoſe three heads: ſo I ſay, theſe are the fleſhly things that all carnall people minde; all their thoughts throughout the year, every one runs either in <hi>ſtabliſhing their own righteouſneſs,</hi> or in <hi>glorying,</hi> and contemplating their outward priviledges, or in projecting for the fulfilling of ſome luſt or other: thus they ſpend their whole life, theſe are the things of the fleſh that carnall men minde.</p>
            <p>Now the other, <hi>the things of the Spirit,</hi> that are contrary to theſe, you may comprehend them all in theſe words; that is,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They are either the things of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Or elſe their <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
               <item>3. Or elſe their <hi>Obedience</hi> to the will of Chriſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All the things of the Spirit are comprehended in theſe three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the things of <hi>Faith.</hi> They minde the <hi>things of the Spirit;</hi> that is, they alway minde and ſtudy how to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and how to lay firmer and righter hold of him, how they may know him more diſtinctly, and hold
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:184889:77"/> him more firmly, and get fuller aſſurance, this is their work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or they are exerciſed about the things of <hi>Hope;</hi> that is, they are contemplating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in their <hi>Happineſs</hi> by Chriſt, how their perſons are juſtified, and their ſins pardoned, and the righteouſneſs of the law fulfilled in them, and all in Heaven and Earth beſtowed on them. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. this is our Religion, we glory in the fleſh as if not, but <hi>we rejoyce in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> but <hi>we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Jeſus,</hi> that is, in all the happineſs we have in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or thirdly and laſtly, the <hi>things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> are the will of God, or the Commands of Jeſus Chriſt; they alway ſtudy how they may obey, and <hi>fulfill the good, and acceptable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will of God.</hi> So that a Saint, if he be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, he is alway either acting his <hi>Faith,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and ſtrengthning that; or he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating his <hi>Happineſs</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt; or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying which way to <hi>glorifie</hi> God, to know what part of the will of God he knows not, and to ſtudy what part of the will of God he knows and remembers, this is his exerciſe. And let this ſuffice to ſhew what <hi>the things of the fleſh,</hi> and what <hi>the things of the Spirit</hi> are.</p>
            <p>Now the third queſtion briefly is, <hi>What is meant by the minding of the things of the Fleſh, and the things of the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:184889:78"/> 1. You muſt under ſtand, firſt, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, as though a man might not think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fleſhly things: for a ſpiritual Saint oft thinks upon fleſhly things in a ſpiritual manner, as to conſider his ſins, to bewail, and to mourn for them; and he may minde earthly worldly things, to <hi>provide things honeſt,</hi> to provide for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Apoſtle ſaith: he may think of his buſineſs. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt here doth not uſe the word <hi>[Frouneſis]</hi> but <hi>[Frounena]; [Frouneſis]</hi> ſignifies <hi>prudence,</hi> or <hi>diſcretion,</hi> or <hi>providence</hi> in buſineſs: he doth not uſe that, leſt we ſhould think that the Holy Ghoſt forbids to <hi>provide,</hi> to be <hi>mindful,</hi> and <hi>careful</hi> of worldly buſineſs, but <hi>[Frounena]</hi> that ſignifies a further thing, as I ſhall ſhew preſently.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now then you muſt underſtand this alſo, that when the Apoſtle ſaith, they <hi>minde the things of the fleſh,</hi> the word doth not onely ſignifie the underſtanding, but it ſignifies all the affections alſo. I could give you divers places of Scripture where this word is ſet downe to expreſſe the working of any affection in the ſoul. Therefore the meaning is not only of the mind that ſtudies, but his affections, his will, the way of his delight, his joy is in earthly things; his care is after fleſhly things.</p>
            <p>But in particular, there are theſe four or five things implied in the word, when they are ſaid to <hi>mind the things of the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:184889:78"/>
            <p> The firſt is that the very care of his heart (as I told you before) is Fleſhly, and carnall. A Chriſtian hath outward worldly things in an outward room, and Jeſus Chriſt next his heart. There is (ſaith one godly man) a cloſet in the heart of a Saint, only to entertaine Jeſus Chriſt; which the Scripture calls the ſpirit frequently: <hi>I worſhip God in my ſpirit, Rom.</hi> 1. And in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>That ye may be ſanctified in your ſpirit.</hi> That is, in the very coare, and quinteſſence of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now a godly man may have many hurries of wordly things, and luſts croſs and come through, but the coar of his heart is for God, and for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>I ſerve the law of the fleſh with my members, and the law of Chriſt with my mind.</hi> That is, inwardly, with the care of my heart: I ſhewed the meaning of that word before, I ſhall not now go further in that.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a man is ſaid to minde wordly things when a man not only thinks of worldly, and fleſhly things, but ſavours of worldly and Fleſhly things: therefore the ſame word <hi>[Frounena]</hi> that is here minding, is oft read to ſavour. As in the Speech of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, thou ſavoureſt the things of the world,</hi> thou haſt a ſmack of it, thou haſt a reliſh of carnall things. So then to mind fleſhly things, is when a man not only thinks of them, and conſiders them but when a man finds moſt joy, and raſt and delight in ſuch kind of things. But a Fleſhly man about

               </gap>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:184889:80"/> worldly or carnal, or if you will about ſinful buſineſſe: O there he is as a fiſh in the water, there he is his own man, he is well, but put him about any ſpirituall thing, let him come to learne a little for his ſoul; or let his Neighbour come to teach him, and admoniſh, and reprove him, he is upon thornes then, he hath no taſt of it at all: now if thou be a fleſhly man thou mindeſt fleſhly things, that is, thou doeſt not only in thy underſtanding conſider of them, but thy ſoul reliſheth them; there thou art thy owne man, when thou art in the middeſt of the world, and the fleſh, and earth, and hell: therefore look to thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to mind fleſhly things, is when the ſtreame, the main of the ſoul goes upon fleſhly, earthly, carnall things; when the things of God are but by buſineſſe to a man. It is no ſo in a ſpirituall man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>He uſeth the world as if he uſed it not,</hi> he mindes little of the world, as little as may be, but the main ſtream of his ſoul is upon Jeſus Chriſt, there he <hi>exerciſeth himſelf day and night,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when a man doth ſtudy and plod continually upon worldly things, upon fleſhly carnal things. When a man takes <hi>care,</hi> for ſo the word is uſed oft in Scripture, as it is uſed <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>If any man doth obſerve a day,</hi> or care for a day, <hi>Curare diem,</hi> as we reade it in the Latine, if one <hi>obſerve</hi> it, and another will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:184889:80"/> not, or will not regard it. When a man <hi>obſerves</hi> and regards, and takes care, and ſtudies, and plods for earthly fleſhly things, this is to minde Fleſhly things. Therefore in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I am glad that your care is renewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me:</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> It is more then care, there is a kinde of ſollicitude, it is <hi>addicere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi> it is a word that ſignifies when a man <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts</hi> him, when he is <hi>given wholly</hi> to a thing; when a man is addicted, and gives his minde wholly to the world, to fulfill his luſts, or to enjoy his pleaſures, this is to minde Fleſhly things.</p>
            <p>Then Fifthly, and laſtly, it is when a man doth judge of things according to the Fleſh: <hi>Non eſt cogitare, &amp;c.</hi> To minde, is not onely to <hi>think</hi> of it, but to <hi>judge of things.</hi> As you have it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>I judge no man according to the fleſh.</hi> If Chriſt Jeſus were here again, I would not look on him according to the fleſh. Now when he ſaith, <hi>They minde the things of the fleſh,</hi> this is the meaning of it, that is, they judge of things in an earthly Fleſhly way, they judge of the worth of things by the <hi>fleſhlineſs,</hi> not by the <hi>ſpiritualneſs</hi> of them. A godly man doth not ſo, all that he accounts of in the world are <hi>the things of God,</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> were it not for that, this world would be a Hell to him: and he judgeth of every man as he hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, he accounts of him as without that,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:184889:81"/> not worth any thing; a carnal man judgeth of things carnally, as they are fleſhly and carnal, and as old <hi>Adam</hi> is ſet up: ſo he judgeth by carnal arguments of ſpiritual things. Thus I have as briefly as I could, opened the meaning of it. I will onely at this time name one Uſe, and leave the reſt till God give another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>You have heard what it is to be <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> and what <hi>the things of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the things of the Spirit</hi> are; and what it is to <hi>minde the things of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the things of the Spirit:</hi> for we may judge of the one by the other.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Now the Leſſon, or the Uſe (as we call it) is this: Hence we may learn and ſee what the reaſon is, why divers people notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the means uſed, even among us in this place, and in other places, why they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to underſtand any thing of Heavenly things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>ſpiritual things.</hi> What is the reaſon? Becauſe they minde them not: and why do they not minde them? Becauſe they are <hi>fleſhly.</hi> I have wondred oft times, and I do believe in my Conſcience, that had I been here but a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth, and had taken any Natural thing under Heaven, had I read a Lecture of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> or of <hi>Logick,</hi> or any thing in your <hi>Trades,</hi> or <hi>State-buſineſs,</hi> there are none either great or ſmall, but could have given ſome account what the man had ſaid: and yet there are ſome among
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:184889:81"/> you, that though we have been ſpeaking to you as the Lord hath enabled us, almoſt theſe two years, yet you are as ignorant, and as unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any thing that hath been ſaid, as if you had been aſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or had been in your graves all this while. It is a wonderful thing that no word ſhould ſtick, nothing in the world of all that hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould ask ſome among us, do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any one paſſage, or any one thing, that the Preacher hath ſpoken of theſe two yeares? they remember not one word. What is the reaſon? You did not mind it: that is the meaning of that word, <hi>Seeing they ſee not, and hearing they heare not;</hi> that was the plague upon that people in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> When a mans minde is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with other things, a man may ride by the door, and one may ſay, did you ſee ſuch a man? he came by your eye; I ſaw him not, ſaith he, <hi>ſeeing he ſaw not;</hi> his eye was on him, but his mind was not, he was thinking ſeriouſly ſomthing elſe; ſo, hearing, they heare not. Many times a man heares a ſound, and is neare enough, yet hearing he heares not, ſo it is with many among us, the Lord pitty them, my heart is ready to burſt every day more and more, to conſider, and think of it; <hi>hearing</hi> they <hi>hear not</hi> all the year long, there is not one notion or <hi>Exhortation</hi> from the Word that ſticks on their ſouls; the reaſon is, they minde not, they <hi>minde</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:184889:82"/> 
               <hi>the things of the fleſh,</hi> they are feeding ſome luſt, they are providing for ſome fancy, or when they are beſt they are contemplating to ſet up a way of <hi>Juſtification by works,</hi> and all becauſe they minde not theſe things. Therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth,</hi> I may well ſay ſo of divers among us, <hi>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken, I have nouriſhed, and brought up Children, and they have rebelled againſt me. The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider. Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth:</hi> As if he had ſaid, I expect that Heaven ſhould <hi>hear,</hi> and that Earth ſhould <hi>hear,</hi> as ſoon as this people, and yet there is nothing further from hearing then <hi>Heaven,</hi> and nothing duller then the <hi>Earth,</hi> and yet the Prophet would Preach to <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> before he would to this dull people: and ſaith he, The <hi>Ox</hi> and the <hi>Aſs know their owners, but my people have not known me.</hi> Why? <hi>They do not conſider,</hi> they do not <hi>minde.</hi> So, you do not <hi>minde</hi> what we ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that, you that are <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> that waſte your <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> in the ſervice of the Devil, that you are under the Curſe of God, and muſt periſh, that there is nothing that you do that is pleaſing to God, till you be born again: did you ever <hi>minde</hi> theſe things, and lay them to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:184889:82"/> 
               <hi>heart?</hi> Did you ever ſay, Yonder man ſpeaks really, and tells us the truth? But you go home when Sermon is done, and ſay, There was a great Company, a <hi>Throng,</hi> and he Preached a little too long, and we muſt go to him again after dinner, and thus you <hi>minde</hi> not; the Lord Jeſus pity you: that is the reaſon that you are ignorant, and will be world without end, becauſe you <hi>minde not ſpiritual things</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the reaſon alſo, why you have carnal people that care no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God, they care not to uſe thoſe means of grace, that the poor Saints do; why, they <hi>minde not ſpiritual things,</hi> they are like <hi>Gallio,</hi> he <hi>cared not for thoſe things,</hi> he was buſie about <hi>natural things.</hi> It was likely he was a wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judicious man, but <hi>he cared not for theſe things.</hi> So, to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Diſcourſes, or Conference of thy Neighbours, or at thy Table of <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> thou art like <hi>Gallio,</hi> thou careſt not for them, and therefore thou reſpecteſt them not.</p>
            <p>Therefore deſire the Lord to put his law in thy mind. O the maine miſery of a man is in his minde, the man is nothing but his mind in a manner; the maine happineſs of a man is in his minde, if the law of God be there. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before ever thou canſt have thy heart good, or thy wiſhes or Prayers good, thou muſt get a good mind, deſire God to put his law in thy minde, for there is the firſt and main work.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:184889:83"/>
            <p> So alſo for the poore Saint; this is the reaſon why the people of God are ſo weaned from the world; thoſe that are ſpirituall Chriſtians, you can eaſily cozen and cheat them, and take away all from them, and they bear it very well: Why ſo? they mind not earthly things, fleſhly things. Let the <hi>Devill</hi> come with all the policie, and power of Hell to cheat them in ſpirituall things, to take away their peace, and crack their communion with God, they will ſee, &amp; be wiſe, and reſiſt; but come and cheat them in worldly things, poor creatures they are quiet, and part with them: as it is the manner of many of you that are rotten Profeſſors, and Self-ſeekers, you make it a trade to abuſe them, but they are quiet, they minde ſpiritual things. As a Cut-purſe that comes into your ſhop, and a man mindes other things, he may eaſily ſteal: ſo the poor Saints are made poor and ſuffering, becauſe they minde God, and heavenly things; or elſe I tell you, if their mindes were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed elſwhere, a Saint could be as cunning, and as wiſe, and worldly as thou: but thou mayeſt eaſily ſteal any thing from him, and cheat and cozen him, becauſe his minde is upon other things, it is upon Heaven, and thoſe bleſſed things. Therefore learn that one thing, learn to underſtand that the main of thy happineſs or miſery is in thy minde; beg of the Lord to give thee a <hi>good minde,</hi> to <hi>write his law in thy minde;</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:184889:83"/> 
               <hi>Without knowledge the minde is not good.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Lord gave the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> up, it is ſaid the miſery came upon their <hi>mindes: blindneſs of heart is hapned to Iſrael;</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; <hi>blindneſs of minde,</hi> there was the main: and there is the excellency of the Saints. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw nothing but fleſh, yet he rejoyced in God in the <hi>law of his minde:</hi> therefore look on it as the fountain of all good and evil; if thy minde be fleſhly and carnall, thou wilt <hi>minde fleſhly things, and love fleſhly things,</hi> and <hi>walke fleſhly,</hi> but if the Lord ſanctifie thy mind, the Lord will give thee ſanctified <hi>affections.</hi>

            <p>IN the former Verſe I told you the Apoſtle holds forth unto us a great Priviledge, the greateſt that I know that a man can have, <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us;</hi> for it doth protect a man from all evils: for all evil is founded upon this, that a man hath not a righteouſneſs to fulfil the law. And he that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:184889:84"/> hath this priviledge, it doth lead him to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all good: for if a man hath a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to fulfil the law, then there is nothing that can keep the Creature from a full enjoyment of his Creator.</p>
            <p>Now this Priviledge being ſo great, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhews us who they are that are partakers of it, who have the actual enjoyment of it; for the worſt fleſhly carnal man may come to be a partaker: but he ſhews who are for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and ſaith he, they are <hi>thoſe that walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit.</hi> That is a ſure way to know and diſtinguiſh them, but it is a <hi>general</hi> way; and therefore the Apoſtle draws down ſome <hi>particulars</hi> from this <hi>general,</hi> that are more known, and eaſie to be diſcerned. As in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1. you ſhall ſee there the ſame kinde of reaſoning, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Jeſus is Chriſt, is born of God</hi> How ſhall we know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

So the Apoſtle in this place, after he had given a general, he comes more
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:184889:84"/> particularly to ſhew it: <hi>They that are after the fleſh do minde the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the Spirit do minde the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If you do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you walk <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> I will ſhew you, I will inſtance in one thing, I will pitch upon the beſt thing that is in a natural man, and that is his <hi>minde;</hi> I will inſtance but in that: for you may know the Lion by his Paw. you may know the man by his minde, for he that is fleſhly, <hi>mindes fleſhly things.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If the minde of a man (which is his beſt thing) be altogether about fleſhly things, then his <hi>Will</hi> is ſo, and his Affections and Actions are ſo: and if the <hi>minde</hi> of a man be upon ſpiritual things, then his Will is ſo, his Affections, his Actions, his whole life is ſo. This is the drift and ſcope of the Apoſtle. Now the Leſſon we had in hand the laſt time from the words, it was as I told you the ſame with the Text here;</p>
            <q>That thoſe that are after, or walk after the fleſh, they do minde fleſhly things, and thoſe that are after the Spirit, do minde ſpiritual things.</q>
            <p>I gave you two Reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>I opened it by anſwering three Queſtions.</p>
            <p>I came to make ſome Uſe of it, and finiſhed onely one, which was, to ſee the reaſon why carnal fleſhly people do know ſo little of <hi>the things of God,</hi> though they have ſo much means,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:184889:85"/> and Ordinances, and have time to enjoy them, and have ears to hear, and Books to reade, and yet they know nothing of ſpiritual things, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>they minde them not.</hi> But I ſhall now proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Another word is this, from this way and method of reaſoning that the Apoſtle uſeth here, you may learn this, That the main and chief miſery of a fleſhly carnal man, is the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his minde. As the chief happineſs of a Chriſtian, the choiceſt piece that is in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is the ſpiritualneſs of his minde; ſo the worſt piece in a carnal man is the fleſhlineſs of his minde. Therefore the Apoſtle doth pitch upon the worſt piece to demonſtrate the reſt, <hi>He that is after the fleſh mindes fleſhly things.</hi> As if he had ſaid, You may eaſily gueſs at the reſt, if the <hi>minde</hi> be naught. You are wonderfully miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken when you ſee a little of your miſery, you complain, Oh, I have a <hi>weak memory,</hi> when I am hearing ſpiritual things I think they are written upon my heart, but I preſently forget it, and I am paſſionate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that is all my fault. Oh but here is the root, thou haſt a <hi>fleſhly minde,</hi> and therefore there are <hi>fleſhly thoughts,</hi> and <hi>fleſhly actions,</hi> all proceed from that.</p>
            <p>The minde of a man is either the chiefeſt Seat for Jeſus Chriſt, or the cheifeſt Throne for the Devil. If Chriſt be in thee, there is his Throne in thy minde; and if Satan, the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:184889:85"/> be in thee, there is his Palace. Therefore you ſhall reade in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. Chriſt throws out the <hi>ſtrong man, the armed man.</hi> Now what is the royal ſeat that the Devil hath in a man? compare that with 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. You ſhall ſee there, it is the Imaginations of the minde, the reaſonings of the minde (of which, God willing, I ſhall ſpeak more after) for as the <hi>minde</hi> is the <hi>chiefeſt faculty</hi> of the ſoul, ſo the reaſonings of the the minde are the cheifeſt acts of the minde. Now the ſtrong holds of Satan muſt be thrown downe, and be brought into captivitie to Jeſus Chriſt, every thought of them. <hi>If thine eye be ſingle,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the whole body is full of light, but if thine be evil, the whole body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be full of darkneſs.</hi> You know that if the eye have light in it, the hands have light to work, and the feet have light to go, and a man knows where h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, what he is doing, and whither he is going, but if the eye be dark the whole body is darkneſs. Juſt ſo, if the eye of the minde have ſpiritual light in it, then the whole man hath light, then all the whole man hath light, then the will hath light, and the affections, and the actions, all have light, but if the eye be dark, if the minde be dark, the whole body is full of darkneſs. If the Coachman (as a godly man ſaith) be blinde, then you know where the coach muſt be. The minde is to the ſoul and body of a man, as a Coachman is to the Coach and Horſes, he guides
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:184889:86"/> them, and if he be blind, or mad, or drunk, then all goes out of order.</p>
            <p>Therefore you ſhall finde that when God in Scripture doth expreſs the height of the miſery of people, he ſets it out by ſome miſery that is upon their mindes; and when the Holy Ghoſt would ſet out the height of what God doth for Chriſtians, he ſets it forth by ſomething that he doth upon their minds. As you have it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi> To be <hi>blinde,</hi> or to be <hi>without judgement</hi> (in the Scriptures language) is to be a <hi>Reprobate.</hi> Therefore when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of <hi>Reprobates,</hi> he takes a word that is the ſame in the Original, and <hi>Reprobate</hi> is the worſt word that is in the Scripture: for it is far worſe to ſay a man is a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> then to ſay he is a wicked man, or a curſed man; for he that is in a curſed condition for the preſent, may be in a bleſſed: but, ſaith he, <hi>The election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, on the other ſide, when God will ſhew the <hi>chief happineſs</hi> of a man, he ſets it forth by ſome good he doth to the minde.

               <p>Firſt, it is <hi>blinde,</hi> that is, it is <hi>darkneſs,</hi> that is the word in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>For ye were ſometimes darkneſs,</hi> you were not onely <hi>dark</hi> but <hi>darkneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:184889:87"/> it ſelf. There is not the leaſt ſpark of ſpiritual light in thee, if thou be yet in the fleſh, if thy minde be fleſhly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is <hi>vain.</hi> What is that? The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> that walked in <hi>the vanity of their mindes, they became vain in their imaginations.</hi>

               <p>What is a <hi>vain minde?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vain</hi> ſignifies <hi>empty</hi> in Scripture, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw all things under the Sun that they were vain;</hi> that is, they are <hi>empty,</hi> they have no good in them. So if thou be a carnal man, thy minde is vain, that is, it is <hi>empty</hi> of all good; there are none of thoſe ſweet Meditations, and Contemplations, and Conſiderations of ſpiritual things, it is quite <hi>empty.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not call thy brother Racha,</hi> that is, <hi>empty,</hi> but thou mayeſt ſay ſo of thy <hi>minde,</hi> thou mayeſt ſay, I have an <hi>empty minde,</hi> a minde that is <hi>Racha,</hi> that is, <hi>empty.</hi> Therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon, The words of the wiſe are as choice ſilver, but the heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> as one godly man faith, his very heart is not worth a half-peny; ſo I may ſay of all thy thoughts, that are yet in the fleſh, all thy thoughts through the year are not worth one <hi>farthing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are <hi>rotten,</hi> or <hi>corrupt, Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of that?</p>
               <p>I ſhall it may be ſpeak more of it by and by, but for the preſent, it is <hi>rotten,</hi> that is, it is not onely <hi>empty of good,</hi> but <hi>full of putrifaction,</hi> it is

               <p n="4">4. It is <hi>polluted:</hi> thy minde being carnal, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawful thing, every indifferent thing, makes thy minde fouler and fouler.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And take heed, take heed poor ſoul, after all this, that thy minde prove not to be a <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde:</hi> you ſhall have the word in <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 28. you may finde in that Chapter that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had a little <hi>natural knowledge of God,</hi> but <hi>they did not know him as God, but became vain in their imagination;</hi> they did not delight to keep the knowledge of God, they were ſorry that they knew ſo much of God, becauſe they could not follow their luſts ſo freely. Well, what ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ver to a reprobate minde,</hi> &amp;c. a minde <hi>void of judgement,</hi> as it is in your Margin, becauſe they had a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and regarded it not. God gave them up to a <hi>reprobate minde,</hi> a minde <hi>void of judgement;</hi> that is, ſuch a minde as never ſhould have the knowledge of God any more; you ſhall know no more, you are troubled that you have a little knowledge of God; ſaith God, I will take
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:184889:88"/> away your judgement, and you ſhall know no more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And then there is a thing worſe then this, and that you will think were very ſtrange; it is not ſtrange to ſay, there is one thing in the minde that is worſe then to be <hi>Reprobate,</hi> and yet thus it is; the word is in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 18. it is called <hi>a proud minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is that?</p>
               <p>That is, notwithſtanding all the miſery of thy minde (and ſo by conſequence of thy whole man) as it is <hi>blinde,</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>rotten,</hi> and <hi>polluted,</hi> and it may be <hi>reprobate,</hi> (I fear it, I fear it) yet notwithſtanding thou haſt a <hi>proud minde.</hi> What is that? If thou compare it with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 2. <hi>Thou haſt ſet thy heart as the heart of God;</hi> there is no carnal man, but he thinks he is as God, he thinks he knoweth all things: that a man which is a mad man, that is wilde and hath no knowledge, yet notwithſtanding that he ſhould conceive that he is wiſe as God, as full of knowledge as God is in a manner; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall ſee in that place, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. ſaith the Lord, <hi>Wilt thou yet ſay before him that ſlayeth thee, I am God?</hi> Not that men ſay ſo with their tongues, but in their hearts, that they are wiſe as God. As there is many a poor carnal man that thinks he is grave and wiſe, that he knows as much as all the Preachers in <hi>London</hi> can teach him, and yet he is <hi>rotten,</hi> and <hi>blinde,</hi> and <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:184889:88"/> and it may be <hi>reprobate</hi> too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learn this Leſſon, that if thou art a fleſhly man, thy great miſery lyes in thy minde; and therefore do not complain ſo much of the ſtreams as the fountain: go to God, and deſire him to <hi>write his law in thy minde;</hi> deſire God, not onely to change thy <hi>memory,</hi> but to give thee a <hi>new minde,</hi> and a <hi>new heart.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. And from this may follow another word, that is, you may hence learn, you that are but yet ſimple and ignorant, never conceive that thy heart is <hi>good</hi> when thy <hi>life is naught,</hi> when thy <hi>words are naught,</hi> and when thy <hi>thoughts are naught,</hi> never ſay that thy <hi>minde</hi> is good, or thy heart is good. For I told thee, thy minde is the fountain of all thy actions, of all thy affections. And therefore do not ſay, Sir, though I can talk but little, and though I ſwear, and be drunk ſometimes, yet I have a <hi>good minde</hi> to God; I ſay that cannot be, for if the Tree be naught, the fruit cannot be good. If I ſee a few ſparks at the top of the Chimney, I am ſure there is a greater fine within; if wickedneſs be in thy tongue, there is a treaſure of wickedneſs in thy heart. If a man hath nothing but baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wickedneſs, and ſinfulneſs in his life and converſation, I will never believe that that man hath a good heart, for if the heart were holy, it would make the whole man holy, and if the minde be naught, it is impoſſible but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:184889:89"/> that the man ſhould be ſo too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Another word you may learn from hence (if you will give me leave to ſhew my judgement. For I ſpeak againſt no man; but thew what God by his grace hath ſhewed to me) as I conceive that it is not the will of God that we ſhould conceive that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt did die equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all men, and redeem all men.</hi> To ſay nothing of other Scriptures; for it is a great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and divers godly men do doubt of it from this Scripture, If we ſay that Chriſt did die for all men equally, or alike, for thoſe that ſhall be damned, and thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. Then it may be asked, who makes the difference? How comes it to paſs that he died for all, ſeeing there are but ſome ſaved? You will anſwer, that ſome beleive, and ſome do not. Then how is it that ſome do beleive, and ſome do not? Surely if Chriſt died for all men alike, then it muſt follow that ſurely ſome men have power to beleive and ſome have not. But this Scripture ſaith plainlie, that the mind of a carnall man, his beſt part is open enmity to God, it is contrary to God: And the Scripture ſaith, that we are <hi>dead in ſins,</hi> therefore a carnall man cannot do any thing that is ſpirituall, a man that is dead, is altogether fleſhly, he cannot believe, or receive Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore I ſay, the Lord Chriſt he gives faith; it is he that <hi>gives repentance</hi> unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus he hath Purchaſed it,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:184889:89"/> (conſider of that) as Chriſt Jeſus hath Purchaſed Salvation for the ſoul, ſo he hath purchaſed Faith for us, to lay hold upon that Salvation. And therefore beſides all other inconveniences in that doctrine (as I have told you before) in my apprehenſion there is abundance of <hi>pride</hi> in it, that we cannot be content to <hi>take Salvation</hi> on Gods terms: ſo that it ſets up a power in man, that if Chriſt died for all alike, then this makes the difference, that one man believes, and another doth not, and then a man hath power in himſelf to believe: whereas this Scripture ſaith, that naturally we have <hi>fleſhly mindes,</hi> and can <hi>minde</hi> nothing but <hi>fleſhly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore let us extoll God, and go to him, and deſire him to work on us, and acknowledge that naturally we are blinde and dead, and can do nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. Then laſtly, let me ſhut up this point (for I ſhall omit ſomewhat more that I had to ſay of it) Every one of you conſider your own ſouls, whether you be <hi>fleſhly minded</hi> people or no, whether you minde the things of the fleſh. If you be, I have a word, a cold word from the Lord to you; I ſay, if you <hi>minde fleſhly things,</hi> (conſidr of it) the Lord ſaith you muſt die, <hi>They that walk after the fleſh muſt die,</hi> whether you be <hi>profane</hi> people (as that is the ordinary diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) people that live in groſs ſins, or whether you be <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of godlineſs, that <hi>minde earthly</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That we may find, whether we walk after the fleſh. or after the ſpirit, I would urge it a little further, and that according to the Apoſtles method: he pitcheth upon the minde, and the minde not ſimply conſidered but as it is acting, and ſetting forth the minde, in <hi>minding:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he takes the chiefeſt facultie to judge the reſt by, ſo I will take the chiefeſt act in that

            <p>Now the chiefeſt act of the minde (doubtleſs) is the <hi>reaſoning</hi> part of the minde There are many acts in the minde; as, it <hi>underſtands,</hi> it <hi>thinks,</hi> it <hi>imagines,</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>reaſoning part:</hi> it belongs to the minde to reaſon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and <hi>Reaſon</hi> is the chiefeſt part, and is called and accounted by Scholars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the chiefeſt part of man; and therefore they ſay that man is a reaſonable creature. Now I ſay, if we will finde ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by the Scriptures what we are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>according to the Spirit</hi> (for there is the hinge of it) we muſt examine it by the <hi>minde;</hi> and not by the minde ſimply, as it is a <hi>faculty,</hi> but the minde acting, and exerciſing: and if we ſpeak of the <hi>exerciſe,</hi> let us take the reaſoning part of it, that is the beſt part, for of all the acts of the minde, the reaſoning is the ſtrongeſt, and that that moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flows from the Underſtanding: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the reaſoning of the Soul be carnal, the whole Soul is ſo, and if the reaſoning of it be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, the whole Soul is ſpiritual: that was one thing that did move me to pitch upon that, it being the chiefeſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides I finde that the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. he diſtinguiſheth thoſe that walk according to the fleſh, from thoſe that walk according to the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:184889:92"/> Spirit, by the <hi>reaſoning part;</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we no man after the fleſh, yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we him no more.</hi> We do not, ſaith he, henceforth walk according to the fleſh; and we know it by our knowledge, we do know things, not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit; if Chriſt himſelf were here, we would not look upon him with a fleſhly eye. What this knowledge is, you may ſee in the verſes before: <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge,</hi> we thus reaſon, <hi>that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> We know, ſaith he, that we are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and not fleſhly, by our <hi>judging</hi> of things, by our <hi>reaſoning</hi> of things; for thus we <hi>judge,</hi> or thus we <hi>reaſon,</hi> that if <hi>one died for all,</hi> that is, did die for all, then ſurely we all are dead. And we reaſon further, that if one man did die for us, and we are ſuffered to live, we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our life, not for our ſelves, but for him that died for us. This kinde of reaſoning we have that walk after the Spirit, and not after the fleſh, therefore I will pitch upon that. And the rather, becauſe the Lord hath been pleaſed, for ends beſt known to him, to keep that in my minde, and to ſix it ſo on my thoughts, that I could not paſs it by, and I uſually judge in

            <p>For ſuch as the mind is, ſo is the whole man, and if your reaſoning be right, then I dare ſay, that all the acts of the minde are right: for that is the chiefeſt, you may judge of all the acts of your minde by your reaſoning: and therefore we cull out that for the triall of the reſt.

            </p>
            <p>And as the Lord preſents it unto me, I ſhall a little open unto you theſe terms, <hi>Reaſoning, Spiritual reaſoning,</hi> and <hi>Fleſhly reaſoning.</hi> That you may underſtand theſe, you muſt conceive that there are three ſorts of <hi>mindes</hi> in the world, and therefore there be three ſorts of <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:184889:93"/> for our reaſonings are according as the minde is.</p>
            <p>There is firſt a <hi>corrupt minde,</hi> as you have it <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>The old man that is corrupt,</hi> that is (to ſpeak in your language, or according to your thoughts) a ſinful minde, a minde that is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about ſinful things: when a mans minde is an evil one, ſimply evil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>natural minde,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. at the latter end, it is called there the <hi>natural man:</hi> where I would have you obſerve by the <hi>by,</hi> that the <hi>minde</hi> is called the <hi>man</hi> there, the natural <hi>man,</hi> that is, the natural <hi>minde: The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man knoweth not the things of God;</hi> that is, the <hi>natural minde,</hi> for a <hi>man</hi> is denominated by his excellenteſt part, which is his <hi>minde,</hi> as I told you before.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, there is alſo the <hi>ſpiritual minde,</hi> which is called there the <hi>ſpiritual man: The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man judgeth all things;</hi> that is, the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual minde</hi> judgeth all things, for it is the minde properly that doth judge, and the man is ſaid to judge, becauſe he hath the minde, or the minde is in the man. According to theſe three ſorts of mindes, flow forth three ſorts of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One is, <hi>corrupt reaſoning,</hi> and that is, when men do reaſon meerly ſinfully, according to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the Apoſtle uſeth their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal phraſe, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:184889:93"/> 
               <hi>we ſhall die.</hi> Now here was a kinde of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this, here was an Argument, to morrow we expect to die, that is, ſhortly, therefore let us eat and drink, and feed our luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here was a reaſoning, but it was <hi>corrupt.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. when they had killed the Servants that came to gather the rents, now ſay they, <hi>the heir is come, come let us kill, and then the Land will be ours.</hi> Here was reaſoning, but it was corrupt reaſoning. So in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 44. there the Diſciples did reaſon <hi>who ſhould be greateſt in the kingdome of God:</hi> there are ſuch reaſonings in our hearts: for man is called a <hi>rational man;</hi> and though ſome men be called <hi>unreaſonable men</hi> (as I ſhall ſhew by and by) yet there is no man but hath reaſonings in him, either <hi>corrupt,</hi> or <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> There is no act that a man doth, but there is ſuch a nimbleneſs in the underſtanding, that it preſently draws ſome Arguments and Reaſon for it: a man never doth any thing, but he hath ſome kinde of reaſon for it, be it what it will be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>natural reaſoning,</hi> and that we oft finde in the Scriptures, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 6. Chriſt had there told a <hi>Leper,</hi> that he had forgiven him his ſins, the Scribes ſitting there, reaſon in their hearts, <hi>Why doth this man ſpeak blaſphemy? who can forgive ſins but God?</hi> This was not properly <hi>corrupt reaſoning,</hi> but <hi>true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; Who can forgive ſins but God?</hi> This
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:184889:94"/> man forgives ſins, therefore it is blaſphemy: they reaſoned right and true, ſo far as natural light could go, but here is the difference between natural and ſpiritual light, natural light comes too ſhort, they did not ſee that he was God. <hi>None can forgive ſins but God,</hi> but they ſaw him not to be God. This was <hi>natural</hi> reaſoning. Why? becauſe it was true according to their principle, had he been but a meer man they had reaſoned very well: but it was natural, becauſe it was lame, and low, and did not riſe up ſo high as to ſee that that man was God, and could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins. So <hi>Peters</hi> reaſoning was rather na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural then corrupt: <hi>Maſter ſpare thy ſelf;</hi> it was natural, and not corrupt reaſoning, becauſe it is good for a Servant to give good counſel to his Maſter. But this was but natural; becauſe though it were honeſt, in a natural way, yet it was lame, it wanted a principle that was ſpiritual, to ſee that it was needful and neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould die (according to the Counſel of God) rather then that all the Elect ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there are ſpirituall reaſonings. As there is a ſpirituall minde; ſo I ſay there are ſpirituall reaſonings in all godlineſs. For all godlineſs, and every peice of it (as I ſhall ſhew) is carried upon reaſon, only it is ſpiritual reaſon. Look upon the whole bulk of godlineſs, you may divide it into three parts. It conſiſts,</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:184889:94"/>
               <item>Either in <hi>believing,</hi> and <hi>doing.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>or in obedience and <hi>doing.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Or in <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>doing.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>All a Chriſtians life is ſpent, either in believing, or in doing, or in ſuffering. Now in all theſe three you ſhall ſee in Scripture that a Saint doth not all theſe hand over head, as being led by a fancie of them, but clearly upon reaſon, and the beſt reaſon in the World, as I ſhall ſhew you anon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for <hi>beleiving,</hi> look to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is our patterne, our coppie. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up Iſaac, and he that had received the promiſes offered up his only begotton ſon: of whom it was ſaid, that in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called, accounting that God was able to raiſe him up from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting,</hi> or as the Greek word is, reaſoning that <hi>God was able to rayſe him from the dead, from whence he received him in a figure.</hi> It is ſaid that by faith <hi>Abraham</hi> offered Iſaac, his only ſon, he that had received the promiſe, God had made the promiſe to <hi>Iſaac; In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called. Iſaac</hi> was his ſon, and a ſon that he had in ſtrong way, by an ancient Woman, and his only ſon, and a ſon of whom the Meſſias ſhould come. Now there muſt be a great deale of reaſon to perſwade ſuch a godly Father to kill ſuch a hopefull child, to put him to death, to whom God had given the promiſe of all
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:184889:95"/> bleſſings, to all Nations. Surely there muſt be a great deale of reaſoning before he could be perſwaded to do this, and yet he did <hi>reaſon</hi> that God was <hi>able to raiſe him from the dead.</hi> This word reaſoning in the Greek is a word taken from Arithmeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ians, that take two or three ſums, and put them together, and tell you this is the reſult of them: ſo he did reaſon, this is my ſon, and all my hopes lie in him; and I received him when I was as a dead man, and for me to go and kill him, will daſh all the hopes of my ſalvation. But on the other ſide, ſpiritual reaſon comes in, and ſaith, that God that gave him me in a figure from the dead, that is, as it were from a dead woman, and when I was an old man, that God is able of his aſhes, when I have killed him, and burned him, to raiſe him up again, and therefore I will go and ſacrifice him; and thence it is that the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>God raiſed him from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved, there is nothing that ſeems to be more <hi>without reaſon</hi> then faith, and in faith there is nothing ſeems to be more without reaſon, then for a man to go and kill his Son, his only Son, and yet he reaſoned, it is ſaid. And ſo in <hi>Romans</hi> 4. He looked not upon fleſh and bloud, but reaſoned from the promiſe, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> What was that? God called him out in a clear night, and ſhewed him the ſtars in the firmament, and ſaid, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> and he
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:184889:95"/> reaſoned, and ſtaggered not, but looked upon God as one that was able to bring it to paſs, and therefore it is ſaid, in hope, above hope, he believed.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſpeake of <hi>Moſes?</hi> You have it in that Chapter, they ſay, old men are twice Children, but <hi>Moſes being forty yeares old, refuſed to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter:</hi> ſome might think what a madneſs this was? the text gives the reaſon, he <hi>reaſoned,</hi> or he <hi>Eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Egypt;</hi> that is, he reaſoned thus, here I am in great honour, I may be called the Son of the Kings Daughter, and here I have hunting and hawking, and riches, &amp;c. and yonder are the poore people of God making brick, and there they have burthens laid upon them every day, and are ſighing, and groaning, and making ſpirituall prayers, and ſaith he, the bleſſing of God is there, and theſe riches are but for a time, and there are the riches that are abiding, and bleſſed, and therefore ſaith the text, <hi>He choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Thus you ſee in theſe inſtances that Faith goes all upon reaſon, upon ſpiritual reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo for <hi>doing;</hi> for obedience, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to <hi>doing,</hi> I will give you that one place, that I had even now, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We thus judge,</hi> or we thus <hi>reaſon, that if one died</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:184889:96"/> 
               <hi>for all, then were all dead.</hi> And further, this is another Concluſion, <hi>He died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> There is no act of obedience that a Saint under the Goſpel doth, but it proceeds from Goſpel Spiritual reaſon: Chriſt died, God reveals this in the Scripture to me, and he ſeals this to my ſoul, that he died for me when I was the verieſt enemy in the world; why then there is all the reaſon in the world, he dying for me, that I ſhould live to him, and ſerve him all the dayes of my life; he redeemed me, and paid a ranſome for me, there is all the reaſon in the world that I ſhould live to him: you muſt not think that the people of God take ſo much pains to deny themſelves, and to be carried on in ſuch hard and rough wayes, but that they are carried on in a way of ſpiritual reaſoning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then for <hi>ſuffering,</hi> which is another part of a Chriſtians life; you ſhall reade in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>If we be children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt, if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together. For I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy of the glory that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in us. Reckon,</hi> or <hi>I reckon,</hi> for it is the ſame word in the Greek, that is, he did put the two ſums together, as one learned Expoſitor ſaith, he put all the ſufferings on the one ſide as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:184889:96"/> light things, as ſhort things, and the Priviledges of the Saints on the other, that we are <hi>ſons,</hi> and <hi>heirs,</hi> and <hi>coheirs</hi> with Chriſt, and that if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall be glorified with him; and ſo after all his reaſoning, he ſaw it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to under go ſufferings with Jeſus Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the gain and the loſs, putting them both together in the Ballance, and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſuffer any thing that God ſhould lay on him. So if we compare this place with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we faint not, but though our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day: for our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> We have abundance of afflictions, as it is known to you <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as he ſaith before, <hi>We are afflicted on every ſide,</hi> there was a great deal of affliction, and yet notwithſtanding he did not faint, he was able to go on, and ſuffer: Why ſo? Not phantaſtically, or raſhly, as many a carnal man may do, for it is not ſo with a Saint, he will chooſe diſhonour when he may have honour, but it is upon good reaſon, I will tell you why; becauſe <hi>though the outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day:</hi> and therefore ſaith he, <hi>our light afflictions which are but for a moment, they work to us an exceeding eternal weight of glory.</hi> As if he had ſaid, the afflictions which are now on me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:184889:97"/> you may conceive them to be great, yet in the Scales of ſpiritual reaſon, I ſee they are but light, and little in compariſon of what the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall ſuffer, and what I have deſerved; and it is but for a moment, it is but for a time, and it doth work an <hi>exceeding,</hi> exceſſive <hi>weight of glory,</hi> and therefore I have all the reaſon in the world to ſuffer afflictions: for, if the outward man ſuffer, the inward man gets by it; and if it be <hi>light,</hi> there is a <hi>weight</hi> of glory; and if it be for a <hi>moment,</hi> there is an <hi>eternal weight of glory.</hi> And ſaith he, <hi>We do not look at things that are ſeen, for they are temporal, but at things that are not ſeen, which are eternal.</hi> We look at things in a ſpiritual way; and thus, ſaith he, I bleſs God I do not faint. And thus we have opened the Leſſon to you, that they that walk according to the fleſh are led by <hi>carnal reaſons,</hi> and they that walk according to the Spirit, are ruled by <hi>ſpiritual reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now before I come to prove the Doctrine unto you, to make way for it, becauſe in my apprehenſion it is a ſpiritual thing (as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter:) There is nothing that I know in this bleſſed Book, that may help you in a clearer way to diſcover your eſtates to you in a ſpiritual way, for ſuch as the <hi>man</hi> is, ſuch is his <hi>minde,</hi> and ſuch as his <hi>actions</hi> are, ſuch is his <hi>minde,</hi> and we may better underſtand the <hi>acts</hi> then the <hi>minde,</hi> and we may better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:184889:97"/> 
               <hi>both,</hi> then the <hi>man.</hi> And therefore that you may underſtand this, I will lay down three things before-hand, before I come to prove the Doctrine, or to apply it.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, there is in all godlineſs, in every part of it, excellent reaſons, there is the pureſt, ſublimeſt, excellenteſt reaſon in godlineſs, Beloved, I may ſay, and ſay truly of godlineſs in a ſpirituall ſence, whatever you may ſay of <hi>Logick</hi> in a naturall way. <hi>Logick</hi> is the art of rerſoning, that is the definition of it, it is the right of reaſoning, ſo godlineſs is the right art of ſpirituall reaſoning. There is not one dram of right ſpirituall reaſoning but in a godly people: and there is not one act in godly people but it is carried on upon the pureſt, and ſublimeſt and excellenteſt reaſoning that is; it is ſuch a kind of reaſon, that the Apoſtle calls it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that is the ſureſt reaſoning in naturall <hi>Logick.</hi> Now in that you have other kind of reaſoning, as conjectures, and probabilities; and other topicks; but godly reaſoning is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, as the Apoſtle ſaith. And therefore in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. Wicked men that have not faith, they are ſaid to be unreaſonable men; he is a wicked man that hath not faith, let him be never ſo honeſt, or civill, yet in Gods language, if he have not faith he is a wicked man; <hi>Paul</hi> prayes that he may be <hi>delivered from unreaſonable men,</hi> from abſurd men as you have it the margin.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:184889:98"/> Now what is it to be abſurd? you ſay when a man carries himſelf illfavouredly, that is abſurd; properly then when a man reaſons not rightly, it is abſurd, as to draw wrong concluſions from premiſes; as to ſay ſuch a Towne is garriſoned by the King, therefore <hi>London</hi> hath the plague, this is abſurd. Now all the actions and doings of wicked men, they are abſurd, there is no more hold of them, then of a rope of ſand. A wicked man may have naturall reaſon, and corrupt reaſon enough, but he is an unreaſonable man, he hath no ſpirituall reaſon.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that godly men, ſpirituall men are ſo conſtant in their Spirits, and in their wayes; indeed they are not abſolutely conſtant becauſe they are godly but in part. As you may ſee in natural things, the difference between a man that is at full age, and hath reaſon, and a Child that is not come up to reaſon, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Be not as little children, toſſed to and fro.</hi> Now what is the reaſon that a Child is ſo inconſtant; he will love a thing to day, and have it to bed with him, and to morrow he will caſt it in the dirt? it is becauſe his actions are carryed by fancie, and he hath not reaſon to rule and ſway him. Now you know a man doth not do, and undo things like a Child. See what difference there is in a naturall way, between a man at full age, and a Child at three or foure yeares old; ſo much, and more difference there
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:184889:98"/> is between a godly, ſpirituall man, and a naturall man: and that is the reaſon, that when a godly man, hears a natural man diſcourſe, &amp; ſay he will do this, and that, he will go to the Wars, and he will take this, and that Garriſon, he ſmiles at it, becauſe he knowes, he will not be conſtant. Take men all along in theſe Wars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſome yeares paſt, whether they were Commanders or others, you ſhall ſee how many brave reſolute men both went; forth, and were here in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at home, and where are they now? But now take a godly man, either in the Army or elſwhere, and you cannot ſay of him, he was ſo, becauſe he is ſo; becauſe he hath ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to carry him along, that the other hath not; he went for the glory of God, and the reſpect of that continues with him, the other went out for a ſhew, for a blaſt, and ſo are turned about with every wind like a Weather-cock, and all this for want of ſpiritual reaſon.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it appears by this, why the Saints that are godly and ſpiritual are ſo comfortable, even in the worſt condition, and why other men are ſo apt to be dejected. Take a Saint, and put him into any condition, and he knows how to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord.</hi> Take a <hi>Paul,</hi> or a <hi>Silas,</hi> and put them in Priſon, and let them be to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to morrow, and yet they can rejoice and ſing, they can <hi>rejoice in tribulation,</hi> as well as in proſperity, but now men that have not faith,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:184889:99"/> that are not ſpiritual, though they laugh loud ſometimes when they are in proſperity, yet when affliction comes they are down again; and this comes from hence, not becauſe godly men are mad-men, that they can rejoice in Chains as men in <hi>Bedlam</hi> do, but it is from <hi>ſpiritual reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> When they are in affliction, they can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; I am now in much ſhame and poverty, but I know that they are in Chriſt, all ſhall turn to their good; they are Chriſts, and all is for their ſalvation. And thus they will draw from the Scriptures, by the help of the Spirit of God, ſuch kind of Arguments as will draw them up, and fill them with joy, even in the worſt condition, which becauſe the others have not, they are up and down, though their laughter be louder, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, yet it is but as <hi>the crackling of thorns,</hi> that end in ſmoke, and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſhes. Oh, the godly are endued with a great deal of ſpiritual reaſoning.</p>
            <p>And hence it was, becauſe there is ſo much reaſon in godlineſs, that the Doctrine of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt by a few Fiſher-men, and contemptible men, without any force of Arms, without any Sword drawn, they have been able to break the great Emperour of the World, and to plant Religion over a great part of the world. It is true, there is no natural reaſon in it in the world, that a hundred, or half a hundred ſhould go forth, and tell a ſtory of a man that was a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:184889:99"/> 
               <hi>Garpenters Son,</hi> a poor man that was at laſt <hi>hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Tree</hi> by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and buried in a Grave; and for a company of poor men that had no Oratory in the world, to go and tell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that by this man is ſalvation, and that they muſt believe in him, and that they had no power in themſelves to do it; and that if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, they muſt deny themſelves, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and mother, and lands, and life, and then they ſhould have a <hi>Reward,</hi> they knew not where nor whence, hereafter in Heaven, but nothing in this world; which there was no natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſwade them to, and there was no Sword to command them; for their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was onely to tell men, that if they <hi>believed, they ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and if they did <hi>not believe,</hi> they muſt <hi>be damned,</hi> and yet we ſee the Goſpel hath prevailed in many Kingdoms of the world, more or leſs. Now when <hi>Mahomet</hi> came, he comes as a great man, and when he was asked, How will you prove your Religion to be true? He takes a Sword, and ſaith, <hi>By this:</hi> Such is the Doctrine of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> but the Doctrine of the Goſpel came not ſo.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt not conceive that the Goſpel works like a <hi>Charm,</hi> that it works upon men like mad-men; but hence it comes to paſs, that though there be no <hi>natural reaſon</hi> in it, nor the <hi>wiſdome of men,</hi> yet they ſpeak <hi>in demonſtration of the Spirit;</hi> they ſpeak <hi>the wiſdome of God to</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:184889:100"/> 
               <hi>them that are perfect.</hi> There is ſpiritual reaſon in every piece of that Doctrine that is able to ſatisfie a man; and were there not ſtronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then any is in the world, men would never yield to it. Thus I have given you a few hints, to ſhew you that there is abundance of profound reaſon in godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when we ſee that godly men are ſo <hi>meek,</hi> ſo <hi>gentle,</hi> ſo <hi>eaſie to be intreated:</hi> Whence is this? From the ſtrength of <hi>ſpiritual reaſon</hi> that is in them. As it is in natural things, you know <hi>women are the weaker veſſels,</hi> the Scripture ſaith ſo, and they are more apt to be <hi>froward</hi> then men. Why ſo? becauſe there is not ſuch ſtrength of reaſon in them. Now men that are at full age, and have ſtrength of reaſon, they will bear unkindneſſes, <hi>it is the glory of a man to paſs by an offence;</hi> it is the wiſdome of a man to paſs by an injury. Now as it is in natural things between a man at full age and a childe, ſuch a difference there is between godly ſpiritual men, and natural men; moſt natural men are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and peeviſh, and very ungentle, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be intreated; but the godly, as far as they are godly, as far as they have the <hi>wiſdome that is from above,</hi> they are made <hi>gentle, and eaſie to be intreated;</hi> becauſe they have ſpiritual reaſon. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a man offer another a great deal of unkindneſs, and ſpeak very ill of him; natural reaſon would ſay, Why ſhould he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:184889:100"/> do this? or why ſhould I bear it? But ſpiritual reaſon comes in, and ſaith, <hi>When they curſe, do you bleſs,</hi> and the Scripture teacheth me, that <hi>Chriſt loved me when I was an enemy,</hi> and ſo ſhould I do to others. There is nothing that may provoke a godly man, but if he hath the uſe of <hi>ſpiritual reaſon,</hi> he may keep his heart meek and calm as may be. Now you muſt not think that the Saints are flocks or ſtones, for a Saint hath as much apprehenſion as a natural man hath; but he hath <hi>ſpiritual reaſon,</hi> that he can ſhape the wrong done him in a ſpiritual Mould, and ſo carry himſelf meekly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is reaſon in godlineſs, and hence it is that the godly in times of Confuſion they can ſee their way in the middeſt of the miſt, when all others are at a loſs, and know not which way to go: a godly man can by <hi>ſpiritual reaſon</hi> ſeek out his way, as there is a full inſtance in theſe Times; all carnal men are at a loſs, and think that all Religion is gone into <hi>confuſion,</hi> and one Governour is gone, and another come, and one man is of <hi>this opinion,</hi> and another of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> the whole World, even thoſe that are meer <hi>Spectators,</hi> they know not which way to go, yet now the Saints that are ſpiritual, they can ſerve God as fully and as ſweetly as ever. Why ſo? becauſe though the others are at a loſs, yet they have their eyes in their heads, and can ſee their way.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:184889:101"/>
            <p> And hence it is, by this <hi>ſpiritual reaſoning,</hi> that the view and contemplation of their lives paſt is ſo ſweet to them, and afforde them ſo much comfort, as far as it was <hi>Religious,</hi> whereas they remember their ſinful actions with ſhame, and natural actions with ſorrow: when we come to be men, we cannot endure to think of our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage when we were Children, as making little Houſes of ſtraws, and of clay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When a man comes to be a man, he rejoiceth more that he hath gotten ſuch a Houſe, and purchaſed ſuch Land, and he rejoiceth in his Wife and Children. There is more pleaſure in the remembrance of a rational act, then of a fantaſtical, though when we were Children there was more pleaſure in a fantaſtical act then in a rational, as a Childe hath more pleaſure and will to make Pyes of Clay, then a man hath to purchaſe a Houſe and Land. So look to your lives paſt, you ſhall ſee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of corrupt acts, that you are aſhamed of; <hi>What profit had you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in thoſe things whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> you are aſhamed to think of your <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening,</hi> &amp;c. and you look upon natural acts with ſorrow; but look upon any ſpiritual godly act, what you have done for Chriſt or the Saints, the comfort of them is as much at the preſent as when you firſt did them, and that is a ſign that they were ſpiritual, otherwiſe the comfort of them would vaniſh away. Thoſe things that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:184889:101"/> we do out of reaſon, have a more <hi>laſting ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and comfort then thoſe that we do out of luſt: that is the reaſon that if a man did a thing for God, though it were forty years ago, yet the ſweetneſs of it is freſh now, it is not ſo in natural or corrupt actions, you befool your ſelves in the one, and blame your ſelves in the other; but ſpiritual actions, you rejoyce in them.</p>
            <p>Again, from this it appears that there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in godlineſs, becauſe godly men are not caught with chaff, they are not caught with luſts as natural men are: you know little Children, how you may catch them with a <hi>Baby;</hi> or a <hi>Top</hi> and a <hi>Scourge,</hi> all the year about, you may feed their fancy by bringing them ſome new Toy home, but a man of forty years old you cannot pleaſe him with a <hi>Baby,</hi> or with a Horſe of wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such is the difference between a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, and a ſpiritual man, you may pleaſe a natural man, and catch him with a good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or ſome ſuch thing, but take a through, full grown ſpiritual man (as we have, bleſſed be God, ſome inſtances in the <hi>Army,</hi> and in the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>City)</hi> you offer him chaff when you offer him theſe things, when you would tempt him to leave God, and to embrace the World. That <hi>German Beaſt,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will not be caught with Gold,</hi> ſuch a man will not be catched with a Bribe; a Saint can
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:184889:102"/> out-reaſon all ſuch luſts, he ſees they are but <hi>the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Thus it appears to you that in godlineſs there is a great deal of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now let me adde this before I go further, there is the <hi>profoundeſt</hi> and moſt excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and reaſoning that can be in godlineſs, and I will demonſtrate it to you in three things. That there is <hi>Reaſon,</hi> you have heard: Now I ſhall ſhew you that there is the <hi>profoundeſt</hi> and the <hi>beſt Reaſon,</hi> and that there is no reaſon to be compared to it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe that in godlineſs there is a <hi>light</hi> put into the Soul, whence a man may reaſon: for man cannot reaſon without <hi>light</hi> put into the minde. That is the reaſon why a Horſe cannot <hi>reaſon,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>light</hi> in him, Underſtanding to deduct one thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now the light we have in natural things is very uncertain, and dim and dark, by reaſon of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, you ſee in natural things how imperfect Arts are, as <hi>Phyſick, &amp;c.</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the principles are few, we gather ſome things from Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the principles are not clear, but ſuch men have tried ſuch and ſuch Concluſions, and ſo they make up an Argument, but this is but dim.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are in Nature but dark and <hi>confuſed Principles;</hi> for Reaſon is a deducting of one thing from another: Reaſon is a dividing,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:184889:102"/> as if you ſhould ſee the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> they draw the River from the main Channel to a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and from that to another: So <hi>Reaſon</hi> is nothing but the drawing forth of the light that is in a man, to this or that uſe, according as there ſhall be occaſion. Now in Nature we have but <hi>dark principles,</hi> and therefore we cannot draw things certainly: but in godlineſs, there are ſuch principles, that every thing in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is called clear <hi>demonſtration.</hi> Demonſtration, that is, when a man ſets forth a thing, when he proves a thing eſſentially, and infallibly: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations are infallible, if they be truly and clearly drawn. So then the meaning of it is, that all the principles of the Goſpel they are clear, and plain, they are demonſtrations infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible to a ſpiritual minde: a carnal man may doubt of them, but <hi>we ſpeak wiſdome to them that are perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, the <hi>faculty</hi> of the Soul whereby we do apprehend this light, and in which we retain theſe <hi>principles,</hi> it is a great deal more excellent. I ſay the <hi>faculty,</hi> that is the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual minde:</hi> for I told you before, there were three mindes. This <hi>ſpiritual minde</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>new Creature:</hi> there is in a Chriſtian the old creature and the new creature; and the Scripture ordinarily calls it the <hi>old man,</hi> and the <hi>new man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the <hi>new man?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:184889:103"/>
            <p> Nothing in the world, but God puts as it were a <hi>new underſtanding</hi> in him; that is, he puts a <hi>new light</hi> in his underſtanding, and frames his underſtanding to be capable of that new light: for the minde we have naturally cannot receive ſpiritual things. Therefore it is not onely a new quality, there is ſomething more, or elſe God would not call it the <hi>new man,</hi> but the new quality, which he doth no where in Scripture: the Lord frames in the Soul a capability, a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to apprehend and reaſon upon Spirituall things; and this is called the <hi>new man,</hi> and this comes from Jeſus Chriſt, and his holy Spirit, and is upon the growing hand more and more.</p>
            <p>Now the other faculty, the <hi>natural faculty,</hi> is corrupt with luſts: <hi>The old man is corrupt.</hi> And when I ſay the <hi>old man,</hi> you muſt take the natural man, as well as the ſinful man. <hi>The old is corrupt;</hi> what is that? he is corrupt, that is, he is <hi>rotten.</hi> How comes he to be <hi>rotten?</hi> He is corrupt by reaſon of the luſts of it: as it is with Timber, it would continue a long time, if it have not rain come upon it, but if rain falls on it, it makes it decay: ſo the natural minde, the natural faculty in <hi>Adam</hi> before he ſinned, was a great deal more clear, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was a better <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> then any man, then all the men in the world; <hi>Adam</hi> was a better <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> a better <hi>Phyſician,</hi> a better any thing. But as ſin raſed the law of God out of mans heart,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:184889:103"/> ſo ſin begun to rot and corrupt the natural excellencies of man, as his minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that right reaſon that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his Fall: you ſee how he did name all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what wiſdome he had, but after his Fall, ſin had not been long in him, but he was more corrupt. As you ſee in a houſe where there is a hole in the Thatch, if the rain come in but two or three dayes, the Timber will not be much rotted, but in time it will ſpoil: ſo we ſee after, when ſin came to increaſe more in the dayes of <hi>Cain,</hi> man was more tainted; and yet ſurely, then Natural knowledge was more excellent then now it is, for you ſee what Inventions they had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and <hi>Building,</hi> and <hi>Tents,</hi> and many things that they invented in Arts.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>It is an eaſie thing to make Tents and Organs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an eaſie thing to perfect a thing that hath been Five thouſand years finding out, but were you now to finde out the thing, it were not eaſie. Now I ſay that ſin doth not, and ruſt the Nature of man more and more; and as ſin gets head more, ſo more and more it will rot the Faculties of man: but the faculty we have in the <hi>new man,</hi> it is new, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tainted, never any drop came into it to corrupt it: for when God creates the <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he makes it a more excellent piece then he
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:184889:104"/> did the old; and this grows more and more: and therefore ſeeing there is clearer light, and excellenter principles, and a profounder facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there muſt needs be a more bleſſed and glorious way of reaſoning in a ſpiritual way, then in a Natural way. I had thought to have gone over the other two things premiſed; but the time is paſt, and therefore I will onely now conclude this with one or two ſhort words of Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. And firſt of all, I will here in love admoniſh you that are the people of God, to take heed of that deviſe of Satan whereby he would perſwade the Saints that there is no reaſon in godlineſs. Reaſon is a word that is much prejudiced among Profeſſors; and if a man ſpeak of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> they are ready to flight it, and ſay, <hi>Shew me Scripture;</hi> as if ſound Spiritual Reaſon, and the Scripture, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another: they are ready to ſay, What do you talk to me of Reaſon, ſhew me a Text for it. It is true, we muſt not talk of carnal, corrupt Reaſon, that is abominable, nor of Natural Reaſon, that is too ſhort; but we may and muſt, in any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to godlineſſe, take in Spirituall Reaſon, and if it hold not with Spirituall Reaſon, do not admit of it, let it be what Opinion it will.</p>
            <p>Moſt of your wanderings and miſtakes do
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:184889:104"/> ariſe from want of obſerving ſpirituall reaſon: we reject reaſon, and go and take a place of Scripture, and ſo hand over head go along, and not deduct things, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> did. But beware of this, for there is nothing in godlineſs but thou mayeſt find ſound reaſon in it; there is no abſurdity in godlineſs; abſurdity belongs to wicked men that have not faith. Take heed of rejecting all kind of reaſon in godlineſs; reject carnall reaſon, and expect godlineſs to be above naturall reaſon, but if there be not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reaſon in what thou doſt, it is not of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a word of exhortation, or invitation to you that are carnall, that you would come in and receive Jeſus Chriſt, that you would imbrace Chriſt, and godlineſs by him.</p>
            <p>Why ſo?</p>
            <p>Becauſe there is nothing in nature that may take with man, but there is that in a more excellent way in grace, if men had grace to heed it. You know what takes with men in nature ordinarily, moſt of mankinde are weak, and come not up ſo high as to action, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; but you know what takes with them, <hi>Riches, and honour,</hi> &amp;c. Now the ſcripture tells us in Chriſt we ſhall inherit all theſe things: ſome affect liberty, here is that alſo, <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever man can fancie, ſaith Chriſt, come and <hi>buy of me Gold, and Rayment, and Milk, and</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:184889:105"/> 
               <hi>Honey, and Kingdomes, and Crowns,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the nature of man is capable of. But there are ſome that feed not upon ſenſuall things, and to tell them of pleaſures, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Riches by Chriſt, doth not ſo much take them: but thou art it may be an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall man, that ſtudieſt the contemplation of things that belong to the underſtanding, if thou wilt come to Chriſt thou ſhalt find ſuch matter for thy underſtanding to work on, rationall things that thou waſt never acquainted with before. There are ſome men if you ſhould give them all the contentments in world, yet if they had not rationall companie, and Books ſuitable to their underſtanding, you could never content them: for indeed that is a greater delight by far which is ſuitable to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then that which fits the fancy; and therefore when that is faſtned on, the other will be gone. As a child, when he is child, he loves tops, and trifles, and the like, but when he comes to be a man he ſlights them. So a man that loves riches, and profit, &amp;c. in a natural way, if he come to ſtudie the arts, he will ſlight riches. So if ever you will draw the man to godlineſs, you muſt give him ſomthing that will delight him, delight his intellectualls. Now I ſay there is that in godlineſs, which all that is in humane Books, is not to be compared to it, it is but folly in compariſon. I will inſtance
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:184889:105"/> in one place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. Where <hi>wiſdome doth cry out in the ſtreets;</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is called <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> is inviting poor ſinners to come to him, <hi>Receive my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and not ſilver, and knowledge rather then choyce Gold. Solomon,</hi> or any wiſe man would prefer inſtruction before gold and ſilver. <hi>For wiſdome is better then Rubies, and all things that may be deſired are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to it.</hi> Theſe are ſenſual things, what is there more in a <hi>Ruby</hi> then a <hi>Pebble,</hi> but onely the fancy. Now <hi>Wiſdome is better then Rubies:</hi> And wouldſt thou know where to have this Wiſdome? <hi>I wiſdome dwell with prudence,</hi> or <hi>with ſubtilty,</hi> as ſome reade it, <hi>and finde out knowledge of witty inventions:</hi> there are not in all the world ſuch <hi>witty inventions</hi> as there are in godlineſs.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian findes out more <hi>witty inventions</hi> in a ſpiritual way in a day, then a hundred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men do in all their life time. And inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a ſpiritual way, are far more taking with a man, then thoſe in a natural way; <hi>Come to me, and I will give thee knowledge of witty inventions,</hi> ſuch matter for thy invention to work on, as thou never hadſt before, I will diſcover ſuch as ſhall ſatisfie thee. I have known one once, that was ready to be diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he could ſee nothing in the world that could ſatisfie his underſtanding, he ſaw all
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:184889:106"/> the world was but a Whirlpool of <hi>vanity and vexation;</hi> and juſt as he was going to turn mad, God let the manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt into his Soul, and that ſatisfied his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was a fit ſubject, there was all the choyce reaſonings in the world to work on; there was enough to ſatisfie his Will, and to keep him in his wits, and to make him comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and joyful, or elſe he was confident he ſhould have been diſtracted.</p>
            <p>For in natural things there is a little comfort, but alwayes man looks upon the back of it, he looks behinde it, and ſaith, What ſhall I do when this is gone?</p>
            <p>Now when Jeſus Chriſt comes in, he ſatisfies the ſoul; a man looks not behinde Chriſts back, to ſay, What ſhall I do when Chriſt is gone? but he, and he onely is enough to ſatisfie a man: therefore art thou a man given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and ſtudy Arts, be adviſed by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, this is the way to finde out <hi>rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> to come to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtudy the deep things of the Goſpel, and there thou ſhalt finde out <hi>witty inventions,</hi> and devices world without end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. One word more, and I have done. Laſtly, hence it doth follow clearly, that godly men that are truly godly and ſpiritual, I do not ſay every paltry hollow-hearted Profeſſor, but a godly ſpiritual man, is the wiſeſt man. Why
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:184889:106"/> ſo? becauſe he hath the moſt excellent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reaſon, he hath a maſs of rationality, that the world knows not of. We may ſay of a godly man, as the Heathen ſaid of a Learned man, <hi>A Learned man hath four eyes, and the Vulgar hath but two;</hi> ſo a godly man hath three eyes, and a naturall man hath but two, and ſcarce that: a natural man can reaſon things, but it is with a corrupt, or natural eye; but a Saint can reaſon with a ſpiritual eye. Natural men have but a little dark light in natural things, but a ſpiritual man can reaſon in natural things, and in ſpiritual too: <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her children.</hi> If a Plow-man ſhould come to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and hear their Diſputes in <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi> he underſtands not the terms, and would think that they were mad, yet <hi>wiſdome is juſtified of her children;</hi> they that know what thoſe <hi>Arts</hi> are, they will ſay they diſputed very well. So the world condemns godlineſs, and thinks that godly men are mad men; but <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is juſtified of her children.</hi> You call it <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>we ſpeak wiſdome to thoſe that be perfect.</hi> And therefore you ſhall have the godly uſually when they are deſcribed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are called <hi>wiſe men,</hi> as it is often in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the wiſe man and the Fool are put in oppoſition, the one to the other; the wiſe man is the godly man, and the foole is the ſinfull man, let him be as wiſe as he will be: &amp; excellent
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:184889:107"/> is that word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. methinks it is a word that ſhould take with us, <hi>He that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, judgeth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man.</hi> What is the meaning of that? that is, put a ſpiritual godly man, with any natural man in the world, let him be never ſo wiſe, he is able to ſee through the naturall man, and to know his principles, by which he goes all along, and the end he aimes at, and what he is like to do, but the naturall man is not able to judge of his principles. As you ſee he that hath a darke Lanthorne he can ſee every body as he goes, but no body ſeeth him; and that is the reaſon that naturall men do ſo little good in their places becauſe they cannot diſcern other men. We have ſeen brave men imployed about actions and deſigns, but they cannot judge ſpiritually, and therefore they do not proſper; Why? becauſe ſome flatterer comes, and cheats them; they want their dark lanthorn, a godly man is able to ſee through a naturall man, and to ſee his principles and ends, and as a wiſe man, will fetch it out. He can judge of things naturally and corruptly, becauſe he hath been ſo himſelf, and he knowes how to judge ſpiritually, which the other cannot do. That is the reaſon that a godly man in a Committee, or a few in the Army or Parliament, they can tell how farre their principles will carry them towards God, or any good work, therefore I would to God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:184889:107"/> this poore Kingdome would be wiſe at laſt, that if there be any buſineſs that requires wiſedome, either in Parliament, or Army, or Committee, or Citty, that they would put in godly men; they have their dark Lanthorns, they can ſee through things, and will not be taken with chaff as others may: you ſee how God hath proſpered and bleſſed them, and how they have continued conſtant. Therefore I ſay henceforth let us not in any place or buſineſs look ſo much to our kindred, or neighbours, or carnall relations, but that God would teach us to chooſe godly men in all places, they are the only wiſe man, and can judge of all others, and are judged of none; if we do not thus, I feare we may repent it when it is too late.</p>

            <p>As the Minde or Underſtanding is the higheſt faculty of the Soul; ſo the reaſonings of the minde are the moſt excellent, and moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acts of the minde. The Minde is Chriſts or the Devils chief Throne. If Chriſt be in the Soul, he keeps his Palace in the Minde; if the Devil be in the Soul, he keeps his Gariſon in the Minde. So the reaſonings of the minde are the chief ſtrength of the minde, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate flowings of the minde. The whole acts of the Soul are like the <hi>New River;</hi> it comes to <hi>London,</hi> and then you have Conduits to receive it, and thoſe ſend it to Wooden Pipes, and thoſe ſend it to Leaden Pipes, and ſo to your Kitchins and Cellars: So the Soul, the Minde is as the <hi>New River,</hi> the reaſoning of the Soul, that is the Conduit that receives it firſt; from the reaſoning it comes to the Will, and Affections, and then it goes out into the Actions: ſo the reaſonings of the minde are the firſt, and chiefeſt, and ſupreme part of all the actions thereof. Therefore if the minde be naught, the whole Soul is naught; if the reaſonings be naught, the whole ſoul and life is naught alſo. But becauſe I would paſs from that, the Uſe of it in a word is this: that</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:184889:109"/>
            <p> Hence we ſee the reaſon, why the wiſeſt men, the moſt rationall men, are uſually the worſt men; becauſe they have more ſtrength of Reaſon then other men: the Reaſon being corrupt and naught, the ſtronger that reaſon is, the worſe the man is. Therefore if I have a childe or a friend that is a wicked man, if he be not made a good man, I wiſh he may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be very rational or reaſonable, becauſe the ſtronger his Reaſon is, being corrupt, the more ill he is in his will and affections, when men are mad with reaſon: many of the Vulgar are <hi>mad without reaſon,</hi> they will hate a thing upon hear-ſay, O ſuch a one is an <hi>Independent,</hi> and this, and that, but when men are mad <hi>with reaſon,</hi> when they have wicked reaſon, they are mad to purpoſe, they are mad <hi>with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> as we ſay.</p>
            <p>And that is the reaſon that the Apoſtle ſaith that the Lord hath not <hi>choſen many wiſe, nor many Noble,</hi> but <hi>ſimple people,</hi> and <hi>ſimple things,</hi> God doth not ordinarily do it. As now in the Army fighting abroad, uſually they do not take great, ſtrong <hi>Garriſons,</hi> but little pettie ones are taken to and again, daily. So, <hi>Not many wiſe men are called;</hi> God takes ſome ſtrong Gariſons: for it is a ſtrong Gariſon of the Devil, when a great learned man is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit of God; it is like <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> &amp;c. fortified ſtrongly, God may take away the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:184889:109"/> of the Devil, and the principal Ordnance he hath, is Carnal Reaſoning, but God doth it not ordinarily.</p>
            <p>It was a Saying of a godly man, and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional one too, he ſhook his head and ſaid, <hi>I wiſh many times in the year, that I were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this Reaſon that is in me, that I might be wholly without Reaſon, that there might be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for faith to work.</hi> He meant that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon comes, and hinders faith, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſpiritual reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſon is ſo troubleſome, if it be carnal, and natural, and unſanctified, that the more any man hath of it, the more enemy he is to God. Therefore, O that God would unbewitch, and undeceive you, and all the people of <hi>England,</hi> that you would not make men your guides, as they are indued with Learning or Reaſon, but the Spirit of God. Go to any Pariſh, or Town, or place, and talk with any man about Heavenly things, and ask him why he doth <hi>think thus?</hi> He will ſay, we have a Learned Doctor in the Pariſh, and he ſaith ſo, and he doth ſo. The Lord hath ſaid that our <hi>Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and our Moon into blood;</hi> that is, all theſe glorious natural things ſhall be daſhed in the <hi>laſt times,</hi> and God will <hi>exalt his Spirit, Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. ſince God hath promiſed it, let us expect it: obſerve what man in the Pariſh hath moſt of the Spirit of God, and of ſpirituall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:184889:110"/> Reaſon, and hear him, and be adviſed by him, and ſay of your great Doctors and learned men, If God be not in them by his Spirit, the more Learning, and the more Reaſon they have, the more enemies they are to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will have nothing to do with them. There you have two things.</p>
            <p>The third thing I ſhall premiſe, is, That the reaſonings of the minde are the chief diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of a man, by which principally above all things one is diſtinguiſhed from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, good men from bad: for the Apoſtle doth not reaſon here, from a <hi>known</hi> thing, to a <hi>darker;</hi> for he reaſons from the minde, and the acts of it, as if he had ſaid, That is the chiefeſt main way, whereby to know the <hi>whole man,</hi> whether he be fleſhly or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
            <p>In natural things, the more eſſential the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, the more certain and ſure it is, and rationality is eſſential to a man, you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a man from a beaſt otherwiſe; a man hath but two Legs, and ſo may be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a Horſe, that hath four; but this is not ſo certain a Character: but when you ſay man is rational, that diſtinguiſheth him from all Birds and Beaſts. So there are many things in godlineſs that you may partly know a Chriſtian by, by his Works, and Affections, and Actions, and by his Company and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:184889:110"/> you may know him a little from another man, but theſe things are outward and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; but his <hi>Reaſon</hi> is eſſential to him, you may know him above all theſe by his reaſoning in his ſoul, that is the moſt eſſential thing to a Chriſtian, as Reaſon in it ſelf conſidered is moſt eſſential to a man.</p>
            <p>Conſider this, for this is a thing by which you may underſtand clearly, what you are made of, and what you are. There is nothing in godlineſs but an Hypocrite and a wicked man may come up to it, unleſs it be this, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by <hi>ſpiritual reaſon.</hi> As for inſtance: a wicked man may know God, he may have a great deal of knowledge of godlineſs, and (to our eyes) of the ſpiritual eſtate of godlineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. He may be enlightened, he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe well, and Preach excellently, and Pray ſpiritually; he may have much knowledge, and all the Saints in the Countrey may account him conſtantly a chief Profeſſor, and a moſt excellent Chriſtian; nay, he may love all good things in a ſort, or for the moſt part: a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man that is but commonly wrought on by the Spirit of God, he may love Prayer, and Hearing, and Reading, and giving to the poor, and other good works, he may love and delight in it, as <hi>Herod</hi> did to hear <hi>John</hi> ſpeak, he may love it for ſome carnal circumſtances about it, and though he love it, yet all runs upon the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:184889:111"/> wheel of carnal reaſon. As for inſtance, I love very much to give to the poor, becauſe the pride of my heart will be much ſatisfied in it. I would be held an eminent Profeſſor, and I invite Saints to my Houſe, and I quarrel with them if they come not, but it is to hold out my Vain-glory, not out of ſpiritual love in my Soul. So there is no piece of godlineſs, but it may be clothed with ſuch Circumſtances, that a natural man may love it, an Hypocrite may do every thing in godlineſs, and be an Hypocrite when he hath done.</p>
            <p>But here is the difference, a Saint loves good, and that flows from <hi>ſpiritual reaſon,</hi> and he doth good from ſpiritual reaſon. As for inſtance; I do not give to the poor to keep correſpondence, and to be well thought of, and becauſe I would be accounted ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor; no, but I do it from ſpiritual reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt loved me, and therefore I will love my Brother. So whatſoever a Saint doth, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reaſon draws him: and this is the moſt eſſential Character that diſtinguiſheth an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite from a true Chriſtian. It is not loving, or knowing, or doing of good, but it is the wheel that it goes on, whether it be ſpiritual or carnal reaſoning.</p>
            <div type="question">
               <head>Queſt.</head>
               <p>But may not a good man do ſome actions from natural or corrupt reaſoning? how is that then a ſure Character?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:184889:111"/>
               <head>Anſw.</head>
               <p>A good man may do an action from carnal reaſoning; but a carnal man can never do good from ſpiritual reaſoning as that ſpeech <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in adviſing of Chriſt not to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was partly natural, and partly corrupt reaſoning: but that you may ſe this clearly notwithſtanding this, you may diſcern him hereby, that</p>
               <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, a Chriſtian is moved by ſpiritual reaſon, and in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, he may be moved by natural reaſon: as ſuppoſe there be a good <hi>Miniſter</hi> that is full of grace; that deſires to do good, and yet he and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ready to ſtarve; the firſt thing that he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God for, is, that he hath opportunity to teach Chriſt to the ſouls of poor people; that is the firſt, but next he ſaith, and bleſſed be God that there is a way to ſupport my family; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon is tyed to ſpritual, as the little boat is to the Ship.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> though a Saint may be carried to an action with corrupt reaſon (that he pays dear for) yet the whole courſe of the life and actions of a Chriſtian flow from ſpiritual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. O! that the Lord would give you to examine your ſelves, by this. It is not by what thou accounteſt of or what thou eſteemeſt or loveſt, but what moves thee? what is the wheel that ſets thee on work? Is it a ſpiritual mind, that gives ſpiritual arguments, that moves thee all the day to good, towards God or man? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that you would carry this with you, this

                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:184889:113"/> is rhe eſſential difference between an <hi>hypocrite</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Ask when thou doeſt an action, not how much thou doeſt, or what men conceive of it? though it be but a ſmall action, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou art a maid that art ſweeping the houſe, or any ſuch mean thing, ask, why do I this? what moves me? what is the main ſpring? is it that my Maſter or Miſtriſs may not chide me? this is natural reaſoning, but thou ſhouldeſt ſay, I do it that I may obey Chriſt, he hath called me and hath redeemed me to live to him: and ſo it may be, a man may do thee an ill turne, and thou wouldeſt not do him a miſchief again, it is a good reſolution: but why doeſt thou not do it? it is not becauſe thou art aſhamed or afraid to do it? But if there be a little ſpring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to think, Chriſt <hi>loved me when I was wicked,</hi> and <hi>therefore I will love him,</hi> O this is excellent.</p>
               <p>The next thing that I ſhould come to ſhew you is, how it comes to paſs that Chriſtians that are right, are ſwayed and ruled by <hi>ſpiritual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,</hi> all their life. I ſhall not have time now but muſt wait on God till he give another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, only I ſhall conclude with two ſhort Uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt hence you may ſee; by this rule you have a <hi>Standard</hi> by you to try how much Grace and how much Corruption there is yet in your ſouls; this is the perfecteſt Standard that I know. Take it by a day, or a week, or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:184889:113"/> an hour, or an action, ſee how much in that action, of day, or hour, or week, thou art carried clearly upon <hi>ſpiritual reaſoning;</hi> ſo much of godlineſs, ſo much of true pure grace there is.</p>
               <p>Look into thy life and actions, good or evil, that is not a jot matter, ſo much of thy life as is carried upon <hi>ſpiritual reaſonings,</hi> ſo much godlineſs there is: It is not how much thou faſteſt or prayeſt, or the like, but how much thou art carried by <hi>ſpiritual reaſoning.</hi> As in <hi>Egypt</hi> they have a Pillar, and figures upon it, and when <hi>Nilus</hi> flows up, they know by thoſe figures how farr the River riſeth higher or lower, and accordingly they ſet their rates on things, and accordingly things will be dearer or cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Or as by your weather-glaſſes, you know whether it will be rain or fair weather. So this Rule would be a <hi>weather-glaſs,</hi> a <hi>Grace-glaſs,</hi> and a <hi>fleſh-glaſs,</hi> that is if thou lay up this in thy ſoul, hereby thou mayeſt know the ebbings and flowings of thy ſoul, whether thou walk better this week then before. It may be Luſt may drive a man to a good thing, but to go to <hi>ſpiritual rationallity,</hi> that is the eſſence of a Chriſtian, as the other <hi>rationallity</hi> is the eſſence of a man. Hereby thou mayeſt know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be nearer to God this week, then thou wert the week before, or whether thou be further from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. The other leſſon, and a ſpecial
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:184889:114"/> leſſon for you to remember from what I have told you concerning ſpiritual reaſoning, is this, hence learn why wiſe men ſo oft miſs the will of God, it is a bleſſed leſſon, why do we ſee godly men many times miſs the will of God, and are quite out in matters of judgement and action, and yet are holy and godly men: It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reaſon not rightly concerning ſuch things, but becauſe the reaſon whereby they reaſon it is more carnal then ſpiritual. As for inſtance, I could name a Book that was written about the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> not long ago, a Book of admirable reaſon, full of rationality, and by a godly man too, and yet he miſt the will of God in it. How came it? Not becauſe he did not reaſon rightly, but becauſe the reaſon he reaſoned by was natural and not ſpiritual. And ſo among Miniſters, they reaſon things through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly, and draw deductions from them, but here they miſs, they look not what reaſon they reaſon by; it may be it is natural reaſon, and that may lead to naturals, but it cannot to ſpirituals.</p>
               <p>This is a rare rule for Chriſtians, when thou art reaſoning, and thy thoughts are buſie about a caſe, and thou deducteſt one thing from another; but ask thy ſelf, I reaſon, but what is this reaſon I reaſon by? is it carnal or ſpiritual? as men that weigh gold or other things, they firſt heave up the ſcales to ſee if they be right; we do not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:184889:114"/> do ſo, and therefore we ordinarily miſs in this. As when a man is in anger, he thinks he never ſpeaks better reaſon than then; he ſpeaks po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully, and he thinks every word is Goſpel, and every word is reaſon, but it is corrupt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo it appears to him next day. Now any luſt may tranſport a man ſo, let a luſt ſet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon on work, and a man will reaſon bravely and rightly; but he doth not take up the Scales before, and ſay, I judge right, but what is it that <hi>I</hi> judge by? A man may ſay he can judge well of the colour of Cloth by the light of a dark Shop, but is that light right? a man ſhould examine that. And ſo in the Synod and other places we ſhould ſee that the reaſon that we judge things by, be ſpiritual, but we take any reaſon, and if it prove natural reaſon, we ſhall have things go naturally, but if it be not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reaſon we go by, we ſhall never attain to judg of ſpiritual things.</p>

               <q>For they that are after the fleſh do minde the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BEloved, I would willingly end what I had to ſay to this Text at this time, and I doubt not but by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I ſhall do it, and therefore I would but only lead you a little, becauſe we were driven to break off abruptly that you may underſtand which way we have been going, when the Lord hath been teaching us hitherto from theſe words.</p>
            <p>I told you, the Apoſtle in the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe</hi> had laid down a great priviledge, and then he ſhews who are the partakers of this priviledge; <hi>They that walk after the ſpirit, and not after the fleſh;</hi> but this is but general, and therefore he ſhews it more particularly, by the beſt part of the man, the minde.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I have ſpoken a little in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the minde, and to follow the Apoſtles
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:184889:115"/> method, I have culd out the chief things in the minde, that is the reaſoning of the minde, from whence I have taught you this Leſſon.</p>
            <q>That, <hi>thoſe that are fleſhly, they are led and ſwayed with fleſhly reaſoning, and thoſe that are ſpiritual, they are led and ſwayed by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reaſoning.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>My end is to diſcover to you, whether you have this priviledge or no, and therefore in the Apoſtles method, I would bolt it out as far as I could. I told you man is a rational creature, and no man doth any action, but there is ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning about it, and though the action be never ſo ſuddain, yet the mind is ſo quick, that it hath ſome kind of reaſoning or other.</p>
            <p>Now for the Explication, I told you there was three minds, carnal, corrupt and ſpiritual; and from thoſe three minds, flowed three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, corrupt, natural and ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>Now for the further proſecuting of it, I told you there were three things I had to premiſe before hand, before I came to prove it.</p>
            <p>One is, that there is the beſt reaſon in the world in godlineſs and religion; godlineſs hath in it all along, the excellenteſt, the beſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonndeſt reaſon that can be, this I proved at large: godlineſs is not as ſome carnal people account it, a vain, giddy thing, but goes all upon reaſon, it is the act of reaſoning, as they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:184889:116"/> ſay of Logick, and not like our natural Logick from probabilities and the like; but it is all upon demonſtration: that's one thing I opened to you, and we had divers uſes then, with which I will not now trouble you.</p>
            <p>Now the ſecond thing I was to premiſe, was this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the reaſoning of the ſoul, it is the higheſt act of the minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I told you the minde is the higheſt faculty in the ſoul: ſo the reaſoning is the firſt, and ſtrongeſt, and moſt immediate act of the mind, and therefore as the minde is the chiefeſt ſeat of Chriſt, if he dwell there, or the chiefeſt garriſon of the Devil if he dwell there; ſo the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſoul are the chiefeſt weapons of the minde, becauſe I told you that theſe they do come immediately from it.</p>
            <p>The third thing was, that the reaſoning is the chief character of a man as reaſon in a man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a natural way, is the moſt proper way of diſtinguiſhing of him from other things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is moſt eſſential to him; for you cannot diſtinguiſh a man ſo properly from a horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath two legs, and that a horſe hath four but by his eſſence he is a rational creature, and therefore I told you a man may know good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, a man may love good and godlineſs, and a man may do good, and ſuffer for good and yet be an Hypocrite, yet be a carnal man. Why?
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:184889:116"/> Becauſe he may do good, and love good, and ſuffer for good, and all out of carnal reaſoning, he may love the good becauſe of ſome fine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial things.</p>
            <p>And therefore I concluded laſt day with two words of uſe, but I muſt endeavour to make good my promiſe. Now the laſt thing is, how it comes to paſs, for I have as in reference to the Doctrine you heard, <hi>That ſpiritual men are ſwayed with ſpiritual reaſons.</hi> How comes it to paſs that they are enabled ſo to reaſon, and to be ſo guided by ſuch Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Beloved, in general, certainly it is only by the ſame ſpirit of God, for I muſt advance the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtill; not in oppoſition to the Scriptures, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me not, for the ſpirit takes of the things of Chriſt, and in the Scriptures, ſheweth you them; but it is the ſpirits teaching you: And therefore it is ſaid, they are after the ſpirit that do minde ſpiritual things, becauſe it is the ſpirit that doth work them to mind ſpiritual things, ye would never mind ſpiritual things elſe. All the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, and all the wit in the World, will never teach a man to make one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Argument to do good or draw him from evil.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, how doth the Spirit do this?</p>
            <p>Beloved, I told you heretofore, that I do not approve of thoſe that do endeavour
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:184889:117"/> to ſhew you too particularly and disbiaſtly, how the ſpirit of God works in the ſoul, as many men have done, and many a godly man, but they have loſt much time, and have puzelled the ſouls of poor people, for thou knoweſt not how a child is formed in the wombe, how his eye is made, and how his noſe is made. And how are we able to diſcover how the Spirit of God works grace in the ſoul, which ordinarily is done that he doth this firſt, and then that, and will not do this until he hath done that, which hath brought forth a deal of curioſity and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſtinctions troubling the people of God.</p>
            <p>But I will give you ſome particulars how he doth it. The wayes whereby he doth, without curioſity, not ſaying he doth this firſt, or that firſt.</p>
            <p>He doth it by a Creation, by ſpiritual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he doth make a Creation in the ſoul, which is called the new man.</p>
            <p>Thou that art there now ſitting in a Pew, that Creature, that old Creature cannot reach the ſpirit of God. It cannot be mended, for we have hearts of ſtone, that will not be cobled nor mended, but taken out wholly: our natures are ſo naught that they cannot be mended; but God comes, and by his holy ſpirit makes a new Creature in the ſoul:</p>
            <p>As man is ſaid to be a man, and hath not his denomination from the groſſer part, as his Legs,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:184889:117"/> or the like; but from the more noble part, his ſoul, and his minde, for where as in one place it is ſaid, <hi>What will it avail a man to get the World and loſe his Soul;</hi> in another it is <hi>loſe himſelf,</hi> So as my ſoul is my ſelf: So there is an old man not according to outward age, but according to the inward. Now he makes thee a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not new Legs and Hands, but new minde, new affections, and new powers in thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now moſt people ſay, that the Lord doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe new qualities into ths ſoul, that whereas thou haſt an underſtanding and it is rotten, and all is full of bad qualities, thou ſhalt have new qualities, thou ſhalt have an underſtanding that will minde heavenly things.</p>
            <p>Beloved, that is true, but I very much doubt whether there be not ſomething more, becauſe the Lord calls it a man, and we never read in the Scripture where he will work new qualities, but a new man: we are created a new creature. Now that is the way, and therefore if ever thou wilt be a ſpiritual man, thou muſt have the Lord to make thee a new Creature. Now the Saints heretofore (pray underſtand me) did not look upon things as we do, we have had ſo many falſe diſtinctions, and ſubdiſtinctions: we have not the ſame notions and diſtinctions they had. They alwayes looked upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man or the new Creature: Now we look without, ſaith <hi>Paul, my inward man gaineth</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:184889:118"/> dayly. If any man be in Chriſt he is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Beloved, that ye may underſtand this, bear with me a little, I do finde in the Scripture that a man is made a Saint, made ſpiritual and holy two wayes.</p>
            <p>One is by renewing a man to that which he was in old <hi>Adam</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by creating things in him that were never there before. And we have theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in Scripture: <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind, and created unto good works:</hi> So that a Saint he is made up unto that condition two wayes; either God hath renewed in him thoſe things he had in <hi>Adam,</hi> or elſe God hath created in him that which was never there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: As for inſtance, God revealeth in him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and continuance, and the like: theſe things were in Adam, and now when a man is made a Saint, they are renewed only upon a new foundation. And withal the Lord creates ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was never in <hi>Adam;</hi> as for inſtance, he creates faith there, that is, <hi>the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> There was a faith in <hi>Adam</hi> without doubt; but that faith of the Goſpel, to believe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to renounce his own righteouſneſs, this was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe it was point-blank contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own condition, for he was to have righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in himſelf, and to renounce it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his condition: Now God creates ſuch a faith in us.</p>
            <pb n="221" facs="tcp:184889:118"/>
            <p> And Beloved, there is another thing and it may be there are many things more: I have had many thoughts of it with ſubmiſſion to the godly and wiſe, I think that Goſpel good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a piece of the New man, which was not in <hi>Adam;</hi> as to do good to Enemies, to love them that hate us, to give drink to a thirſty Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; When one is wicked and ungodly, and doth deal deſpightfully with us, as Chriſt ſaith; then to do him good, and bleſs when he curſeth, and pray for him that injureth us: Beloved, this is Goſpel-goodneſs; I have had many thoughts of it, had I time to prove that this Goſpel good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a piece of the New creature that was not in old <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was goodneſs in <hi>Adam,</hi> but not this; as for inſtance, there are divers things we finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Profeſſors that in the laſt day will be found to be nothing but the old <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi> that are humbled to the height, and ye ſhall ſee in them a great deal of diligence in Gods ſervice, but where will you finde a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, one of 500. and I ſpeak with the leaſt, that you may clearly reade Goſpel-goodneſs in him; that you may ſay, yonder is a man, that if you curſe him he will love you, and if you do him hurt, and that deſpitefully, he will pray for you. It is an eaſie thing to kindle a brand that hath been once lighted, to do that which <hi>Adam</hi> did, but to do this is a higher matter.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:184889:119"/>
            <p> As man was created after the Image of God: ſo the Creatures (in a ſort) were created after the image of man: now as in Creatures, in a Dog there is love and the like: But where is there a creature, that if you do him miſchief, will not endeavour to do you the like again, or at leaſt wiſe run away.</p>
            <p>But where is a piece in the old Creation that doth love his Enemies. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Adam was created after the Image of God,</hi> and God loves his Enemies: I anſwer, God then in that Covenant was not in a diſpoſition to love his Enemies, but to hate his Enemies and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and curſe them, and damn them; but now in Jeſus Chriſt he loves his Enemies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to his minde he revealed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> it was not ſo; and many other reaſons I had, but this I preſent to you with ſubmiſſion, I do not ſpeak curioſities, but I finde and ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of this, ſcarcely any; there was a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did goodneſs in the Primitive Church, which is not now to be, which is not now to be found; now nothing but biting, and tearing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another, well there is one word, he doth it by a ſpirittal Creation.</p>
            <p>Then Secondly, he brings the ſoul to this way of ſpiritual reaſoning, by ſpiritual illumination, he created faculties before, and now he caſteth in Light as he did in the <hi>old Creation;</hi> you know he made Heaven and Earth in the lump, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:184889:119"/> then ſaid <hi>Let there be Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that is the reaſon when the Goſpel is preached, and there is the ſpirit of God going with the Word, and thou art dark and canſt not receive this light; the new Creature is not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in thee, if thou haſt no eyes thou canſt not ſee, and if a man have eyes he cannot ſee in a dark room. Now when the new man is made then the Lord ſends in light, and it is not every light, for there are many Lights, a blinde man (as it were) an Hypocrite hath them; but it is a powerful Light that God puts in, for we do finde that there is a kinde of Light in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, but yet there is no power in them, there is not Light to bring them to ſuch kinde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning as will bring them to any good or from any evil, they will talk of Drunkenneſs and Whoredome, and the like but have not power to bring them off from any of theſe things: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Saint may be overcome of his Luſts <hi>that war in his members, but there is a Law in his minde,</hi> that is <hi>there is a Light that is like unto a Law that hath power in it, that he ſeeth Chriſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them away.</hi> I am ſorry I have not time to open this unto you further but remember it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Lord will do it by ſuggeſtion, that is, the ſpirit of God puts light into the ſoul, he puts a meaſure of light to dwell in every new creature, and that powerfully. But becauſe the way of the ſaints are ſo dark in this World
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:184889:120"/> and thorow ſo much difficulty, the ſpirit of God prompts a Saint alwayes when he is at a loſs. As among Schollars, we ſhall ſee ſometimes a man is almoſt born down, and then another giveth him an Argument or Diſtinction to help him, and then he carries it: and ſo the fleſh hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and arguments as we are going along, and now though there be a meaſure of light, a ſtock of light dwelling in us, yet we are nonpluſſed by the fleſh, and then the ſpirit of God ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth ſomewhat to us, and we are carried thorow as you have it in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>When you are brought before Governours, it is not you that ſpeak but the ſpirit of God that prompteth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the ſpirit doth it by conviction, that is another way, we have it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. ſaith Chriſt, when I go I will ſend my ſpirit, and my ſpirit ſhall convince the World of ſin; reprove you have it, <hi>he ſhall convince the World of ſin of righteouſneſs and Judgement.</hi> The word ſignifies, when he ſaith the ſpirit will convince, that is, by way of Argument, the meaning is, that in every carnal mans heart there are arguments againſt faith, and for his own deſtruction and ſtrong ones too. And when we preach to you, ye bring reaſon againſt reaſon, and ſo go away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convinced unconverted; but the ſpirit will convince you, that is, he will bring ſuch ſtrong arguments (as <hi>Doctor PRESTON</hi> ſaith) from Heaven, that will convince you.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:184889:120"/>
            <p> As when a ſtronger man cometh, he diſarmeth the other: as before we thought godlineſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> and the like; but now the <hi>Spirit convinceth</hi> you, you ſee this is the onely way, and out of this way I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee God, and the like.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another way I find the ſpirit doth it by, is, commemoration, by minding us of what we have heard, of ſomthing we have known before; it it is our remembrancer. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, I will ſend <hi>my Spirit,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall bring to your remembrance</hi> what you have heard, not that you ſhall remember a <hi>whole Sermon</hi> and <hi>Repeat</hi> it every word; but thus it is, he will either ſuggeſt thoughts we never had before, or bring to our remembrance a word we have heard of ſuch a preacher, in ſuch a place, or read in ſuch a place, or thought in ſuch a walke, or the like: and ſo ſetteth on, and carrieth on the worke.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And he doth it by <hi>conſolation,</hi> he is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the conſolation of the ſpirit. Beloved, this is certaine, that ye know trouble of minde exceedingly hinders the acts of reaſon. That is the reaſon men are mad, becauſe ſome fumes riſe up in the braine and trouble the minde, that they cannot reaſon, but are mad. Beloved our <hi>troubles of minde, and ſoule,</hi> they are like fumes that come up into the braine and diſtract us. A ſpirituall man is many times, as it were,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:184889:121"/> a diſtracted man; there are ſo many ſumes, ſuch horrour and guilt, that he is almoſt ſtark mad; he can talke of naturall things, but in ſpirituall things he is as it were mad; the Chaine of ſpirituall reaſon is broken, and now the ſpirit is the Comforter, and he quiets the the ſpirits: and when a man is in a quiet temper, the diſeaſe is gone and the reaſon comes into the minde, and as the Philoſopher ſaid, ye know in naturall things, a man can reaſon when he is not troubled, ſo it is in the ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another way is by <hi>Sanctification,</hi> by the Spirit, he is the Spirit of Sanctification, it makes the ſoul holy, it takes away luſt and ſin from the ſoul. This I finde in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22, 23. I would open that place, but cannot, therefore pray conſider: ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thy eye be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall be full of light.</hi> He doth oppoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs unto evil; <hi>if thine eye be ſingle,</hi> that is, if thy eye be purged from all guile, that there is no ſin there, not when a man hath <hi>one eye</hi> to God, and the other to ſin, to the world; but if <hi>thy eye be evil,</hi> that is ſinful, then <hi>thy whole body is full of darkneſs.</hi> Therefore <hi>bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Well, laſtly, there is another way, there are divers more, but I will name but one more: and that is, The Spirit of God doth <hi>teach</hi> the Saints thus to reaſon, by exerciſing, that is, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:184889:121"/> them to exerciſe and improve that light that they have. There is a little light, natural light, and there is a kinde of ſpiritual light that an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite hath; but the Spirit of God doth not help him to improve that light, and therefore that light dieth, he blows not up the fire: you know men come to reaſon by reaſoning, and exerciſe of reaſon makes men rational, I mean makes them know how to reaſon. Now hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites do not thus, as you may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. there they <hi>knew</hi> God, and <hi>becauſe they glorified him not as God, they became vain in their imaginations,</hi> or in their reaſonings, as it is in the Original, <hi>God gave them up to a reprobate minde,</hi> becauſe they glorified not God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Beloved I have three or foure uſes but I feare I ſhall not reach them all, I am overloath to tire you and my ſelf. Therefore I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with one word, and that is this: That from hence, from this that hath been ſaid, you may ſee what is the Fountain of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of all evil in the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of all <hi>good,</hi> as I have at large lookt upon it, but can but touch. Take any <hi>good,</hi> and you ſhall ſee it is carried on by ſpiritual reaſoning; as take Faith, <hi>Abraham reaſoned,</hi> He that gave him a Son at a hundred years old, could raiſe him up again. Take your <hi>Conſolation,</hi> it comes out by ſpiritual reaſoning; take <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> they were in priſon, and ready to be brought
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:184889:122"/> out the next day to die, now one would think they were mad there to ſing, but they did it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpiritual reaſons, for they accounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bleſſed to ſuffer for Chriſt, and if they die they ſhall then be with Chriſt,—for hating of evil, you ſhall ſee whence is it as <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out the right eye,</hi> or <hi>cutting off the right hand;</hi> that is, one would think, a moſt unreaſonable thing: but Chriſt giveth a reaſon for it. <hi>It is better to go into Heaven, it is better to enter into life halt or maimed, rather then having two hands, or two feet to be caſt into everlaſting fire.</hi> So a Saint can reaſon ſpiritually, and thus he loves the Saints, and hates ſin, and denieth himſelfe, and performeth every dutie, he ſo reaſoneth that it is the bleſſed will of God he ſhould do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo for evill; whence comes ſin? from vanity of the minde: whence comes perſecution? <hi>they think they do God good ſervice:</hi> there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is a good thing to ſuppreſs theſe Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, ſay ſome, and to have Conformity, and be all of one minde, and to baniſh them and let them all go: whence is this? it is either from corrupt or natural reaſon. And ſo when men hear the Word of God, and forget it, they like it well, as a man doth that ſees his face in a glaſs, but they go away and forget it; and whence is it? why <hi>James</hi> tells you, <hi>Deceive not your ſelves.</hi> Deceiving your ſelves; the word in the Original is, by <hi>falſe reaſonings.</hi> A man
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:184889:122"/> hears the Word, and thinks ſurely I am in this evil condition, and I am out of the way, and I muſt look after Chriſt, and the like: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards comes <hi>natural reaſon,</hi> ſaying, theſe are but <hi>new denies,</hi> and what is become of our fathers, and the like? Beloved, all good is carried into the ſoul upon the wings of ſpiritual reaſon, and all evil upon natural and corrupt reaſon: and therefore I conclude all, beſeeching you that you would ſtudy and endeavour to get up your ſouls and your converſations accordingly to be ſwayed and carried on by a <hi>ſpiritual minde,</hi> by <hi>ſpiritual reaſoning,</hi> for here we ſpeak of your Conſciences, not of your lives ſo much, as of your hearts and mindes. And that you may ſo do, take the Motive which follows in the Text, which I did purpoſe, had God given me ſtrength and time, to open: but take it in the groſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is life and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be perſwaded to go home and pray the Lord to create this in you, yea and enlighten you; <hi>For to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded is life and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things I have here to ſay; <hi>To be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally minded is death,</hi> you muſt expound it by the other that opoſeth it; its contrary to life and peace, it is death and trouble, and the other is life and peace. Death and trouble, if thou wilt be a carnal man, and go on ſo, there is nothing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:184889:123"/> in all thy courſe but death and trouble; that is there is death at the end of it. Remember that the end of thy Journey is death. Remember as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>They minde earthly things,</hi> and I write <hi>weeping, that their end is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> It is a fine thing to be carried all our life long, from one carnal thing to another, and provide for my <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the like, and do this and that good action upon carnal reaſons, and with a carnal eye; but God hath put a ſad end to it, it is <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the other it is <hi>Life,</hi> eternal life; though it be rough for me every day to diſpute with my carnal heart, and not onely carry on good, but deny my ſelf in good, upon ſpiritual reaſon, this is a warfare, but the end is <hi>life,</hi> and it is <hi>peace</hi> too.</p>
            <p>This is a hard work you will ſay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will take the eaſieſt and ſmalleſt work.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I ſay there is more eaſe, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and contentedneſs, in going on in the wayes of God <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> upon <hi>ſpiritual reaſons,</hi> an hundred-fold, then in the other; for the other will be rough, and God hath caſt it ſo, God hath put a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon all <hi>Old Adam,</hi> he curſeth it with <hi>death,</hi> and therefore he muſt die that walks carnally: and that is the reaſon all your <hi>natural thoughts</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> are ſo bitter; God hath curſed them, they muſt die, and now all the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:184889:123"/> wayes of <hi>Holineſs</hi> have enough to induce thee to endeavour to walk holily: as one ſaith, The <hi>gleanings</hi> of the Saints, are better then the <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi> of the wicked men, if there were no <hi>Hell</hi> nor <hi>Heaven</hi> hereafter, but onely the wicked to have the <hi>pleaſures of ſin</hi> here, and the Saints to have the <hi>Conſolations of the Spirit</hi> dwelling in them, it is more an hundred-fold; the one is nothing but <hi>crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> and the end is <hi>ſmoke</hi> and <hi>ſtink;</hi> and the other is <hi>ſweet</hi> here, and in the end <hi>bleſſed eternally:</hi> if it were not, ſuppoſe though the way to <hi>Heaven</hi> be <hi>bitter</hi> here, yet it is <hi>ſweet</hi> in the <hi>end;</hi> and the way of the <hi>world ſweet</hi> here, and <hi>bitter</hi> in the end, yet you ſhould chooſe <hi>Holineſs:</hi> as a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaid, If a man were to take a <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>ſweet</hi> thing, which were he beſt to take firſt? ſaith he, to take the <hi>ſowre,</hi> or the <hi>evil</hi> firſt; and the <hi>ſweet,</hi> for the hope of the good to come, will <hi>ſweeten</hi> the preſent evil: but when a man hath the <hi>good</hi> firſt, the fear of the <hi>evil</hi> to come will marre all; but therefore ſeeing there is a <hi>reward</hi> in the way <hi>in Holineſs,</hi> as well as in the end <hi>for Holineſs,</hi> it ſhould move us to labour after Holineſs.</p>
